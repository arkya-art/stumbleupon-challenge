image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy at least that s what international business machines corp sees in its crystal ball the predictions are part of an annual tradition for the armonk new york based company which surveys its       researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years ibm the world s largest provider of computer services looks to silicon valley for input gleaning many ideas from its almaden research center in san jose california holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list the predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers these are all stretch goals and that s good said paul saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm discern in san francisco in an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing for ibm it s not just idle speculation the company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth saffo said not all of its predictions pan out though ibm was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance when the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as ibm s bottom line he said research spending they have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at stanford university ibm invested     billion in research and development last year     percent of revenue while that s down from about    percent in the early     s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals hewlett packard co the top maker of personal computers spent     percent last year at almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with ibm s computer business the lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs     miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data ibm rose   cents to        at       a m in new york stock exchange composite trading the stock had gained    percent this year before today citizen science the list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said josephine cheng a vice president at ibm s almaden lab all this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at ibm and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said many of the predictions are based on projects that ibm has in the works one of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative earlier this year ibm teamed up with the california state water resources control board and the city of san jose environmental services to help gather information about waterways researchers from almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions the hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves traffic predictors ibm also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck batteries may last    times longer in      than today ibm says rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge the final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool ibm scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices in ibm s first list of predictions compiled at the end of      researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm that hasn t happened yet while some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in star trek second life the company also predicted that online immersive environments such as second life would become more widespread while immersive video games are as popular as ever second life s growth has slowed internet users are flocking instead to the more   d environments of facebook inc and twitter inc meanwhile a      prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones the nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought saffo said if everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job to contact the reporter on this story ryan flinn in san francisco at rflinn bloomberg net to contact the editor responsible for this story tom giles at tgiles  bloomberg net by       your mobile phone will project a   d image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be

       " 'friends built the alton brown flower pot smoker a few months back and then visited this weekend and convinced me to build one for the fourth getting the parts while the actual construction of the smoker is trivial i found that gathering all of the needed items was challenging many of the items were hard to source if you live in seattle the guide below should help tremendously generally speaking i would recommend that you try ordering everything but the pot bowl and bricks online pot size selection the two hardest to source parts drive pot size selection the terra cotta bowl is hard to find the    bowl is the largest i was able to find anywhere it is also really heavy so it is impractical to order online however if you can find an    bowl i would be pretty tempted to get an    pot you can definitely fit the weber      replacement charcoal grate in the pot it is actually about    or possibly even the      grill grate it is slightly less than    in actual diameter not only would you get more cooking surface but you d also have a much easier to source grate parts list itempricesourcecomments   terra cotta pot   home depotthey had these at city peoples but i didn t stop there until later    terra cotta bowl   city peoples garden storehard to find try garden nursery stores i think it is also called an azalea bowl some people use saucers that they drill into heat element   walgreens amazonthere are reports of insufficiently sized heat elements this is a     w element that others have had success with the maxi matic esb    x is nearly identical to the walgreens element i originally used the interior wires are a little shorter and thinner but otherwise the construction is nearly identical    grill grate   sutter hearth home in ballardthe standard weber sizes       and    are available everywhere unfortunately they don t fit order a    grate online well in advance i ended up using a more expensive grill topper grill thermometer   sutter home hearthshockingly hard to find try ordering online pan for wood chips unkour kitchenshould be easy to find get as heavy a pan as possible ceramic pot feet  stoneway hardwarethese are pretty easy to find elsewhere   bricks     home depotcould be    s or anything else to get the smoker above the base   lb pecan wood chunks   sutter hearth homeplan ahead and consider ordering online i later found apple and cherry chunks at stoneway hardware for much less we used about     of the wood getting the heat element controls out of the smoker i wanted to get the controls for the heat element outside of the smoker so that i could adjust the heat without opening the smoker this approach had the added advantage of getting the plastic base and overheat sensor out of the hot pot this was shockingly easy to do these instructions are for the walgreens hot plate which seems to be pretty commonly used i m assuming that you re smart enough not to plug in the hot plate remove the screw that connects the burner to the plastic base there is just one screw and its in the middle of the burner at the top disconnect the wires from the heat element they are meant to be easily disconnected and reconnected all you need to do is press the tab and pull the wire and connector off of the pin place some foil or preferably a non conductor over the exposed base to catch any drippings that may fall out of the pot we had none escape keep the foil clear of the control element center the hot plate base amongst the bricks see photo and run the wires up the hole in the bottom reconnect them to the heat element i don t think it matters but the fat wire was originally connected to the prong that runs to the center of the heat element i used both bricks and the pot holder feet so that i could raise the smoker up off the base plate and allow air to flow up through the hole in the pot i then placed a brick in bottom of the smoker to support the heat element and keep the electrical prongs off the base of the pot i had to chip the corners of the brick so that it could sit to the side of the hole for air flow obviously the wiring is much more exposed than it was in the sealed hot plate it is actually very hard to touch the wires during operation but be careful also i d highly recommend you ensure that you re plugged into a gfci protected outlet all outdoor outlets in buildings built after the mid eighties are required to be gfci protected temperature management and monitoring the temp at the top of the grill does a good job telling the temp inside the smoker we kept wireless temp probes in the meat throughout the process metal smokers vs the flower pot vs the big green egg you can buy a metal smoker from wal mart or other sources for less than you ll spend assembling the flower pot smoker i ve never cooked with a metallic smoker but based on other comments i ve read the inexpensive ones are thin and shed heat tremendously quickly when we were finished smoking the internal temp was about     two hours later it was     four hours later it was still warm to the touch the terra cotta simply holds the heat really well the ambient air was in the sixties with a strong wind on our roof deck however the flower pot is no match for the big green eggs these ceramic smokers are massive the equivalent size to the flower pot is probably the large egg which has an    diameter cooking area weighs     lbs and retails for     plus i can t imagine i d have had as much fun as i did figuring the flower pot smoker out recipe we cooked two    lb boston butts on the  th using alton brown s recipe for the brine and rub it turned out fantastically well enjoy updatehamilton posted a series of really good questions alongside one of the photos and i wanted to include the questions and my responses here as i think they ll help other people i was wondering if you think it would be feasible to run a second walgreen s burner through that bottom hole and into the pot this may give me the potential for more heat and heat control in the winter months when the weather is a little cooler here in south carolina maybe stagger them in the pot one above the other or even side by side standing up i don t think you ll need to do this we had trouble keeping the heat down in the target     range and never had the dial anywhere near the halfway point by the end of the session i don t think the dial would go any lower also these are     w burners   amps many household circuits are    amps some are    so you d run the risk of blowing a fuse if you plugged them into the same circuit however if you did do it i don t think you d want to stagger them as the heat from the lower one may melt the solder on the higher one side by side would work but you d need something else to set the grate on also when you disconnect the burner from the base do you have enough length in the wire to connect the burner back to the burner once you ve run it through the hole with the original connections or do i need to buy some extension wires it is tight but there is enough wire if you do need to get wire make sure it is thermally insulated what was the highest temp you were able to see in your cooker we accidentally let it rise to around         is the target at some point i ll do a controlled test but it could definitely go much higher do you soak your wood chips as well as leave water in the bottom of the pan when do you like to put the chips in the cooker when the cooker comes up to temp we used chunks instead of chips as they are less likely to actually catch fire i ve read that you don t need to soak them but a friend advised to soak half this way the dry ones start smoking early and the wet ones start smoking later so you don t need to lift the top until later in the cooking process lifting the top lets out the smoke and cools everything slightly do you end up adding more chips to the pan throughout the cooking process if so what is your advice for removing the grill surface and the meat we added wood once and only opened the top twice the second time we lifted the top was to rotate the butts the meat can be easily removed using foil and oven mitts we had a plate with foil on the side to set them on if you look carefully at the picture of the butts you ll see two screws sticking up through the cooking surface we gripped the screws with oven mitts and lifted it directly out it did take a bit of effort as it was kind of jammed down there to remove the upper pot lid have you come up with a good handle or do you have an alternative method as your graph shows i guess it s a little hot and awkward to fooling around with when it s that hot it shockingly isn t too hot to touch the lid measurements are from the interior the exterior of the terra cotta is definitely cooler some people claim that they can use their bare hands i just used oven mitts but used my hands to make minor adjustments would it be beneficial to drill more holes in the bottom of the pot to let in more fresh air or do you think that would let too much heat out i don t think you want to do this you don t want the wood to burn heavy air flow you want it to combust enough to smoke we had absolutely no problems with air flow ',\n",

resistant to antibiotic treatment alternatively there are effective laser treatments but these are costly and typically not covered by insurance now researchers are scrambling to come up with new treatments for acne one promising possibility involves harnessing a harmless virus living on skin that naturally seeks out and kills the bacteria that cause pimples people always notice it s every teenager s nightmare big blistery red bumps on their faces that s what people notice first about you so no matter how great of a person you are no matter how pretty your eyes are how nice your smile is people always notice the blemishes on your face says rohini bagrodia a really pretty    year old with beautiful eyes a great smile and a history of battling acne in school it meant avoiding the spotlight i would always shy away from those opportunities that would bring all the focus on me bagrodia says she wouldn t take part in class discussions she wouldn t raise her hand and it s all because of a tiny bacteria that lives on the skin ucla dermatologist dr jenny kim says many people don t realize it s bacteria that cause acne some people say your face is dirty you need to clean it more scrub more don t eat chocolate things like that but really it s caused by bacteria and the oil inside the pore allows the bacteria to overpopulate kim says for most teenagers with mild acne over the counter products containing peroxide or salicylic acid are enough to clear up the acne but lots of teenagers end up in the doctor s office and getting antibiotics this was the hardest thing for bagrodia no matter how much she followed doctors orders diligently cleaning her face and using antibiotic cream nothing worked antibiotic resistant bacteria dermatologist elizabeth martin is in private practice in birmingham ala and is a fellow with the american academy of dermatology she says these bacteria like many others are mutating quickly and becoming resistant to antibiotics over the years we have seen an increase in this antibiotic resistant bacterium both in the u s and also worldwide martin says she points to studies that show a tripling of drug resistant acne bacteria over the past few decades this means doctors can no longer rely on antibiotics alone most doctors now use a combination of low dose antibiotics along with benzoyl peroxide which also kills acne causing bacteria as martin says benzoyl peroxide works to decrease bacteria through a different mechanism than antibiotics and it helps to prevent development of resistant bacteria when we combine benzoyl peroxide along with an antibiotic patients tend to have better clearance of their acne than when we use antibiotics alone other treatment options retinoids vitamin a derivatives can also be used early on to treat acne typically creams they work by unclogging pores before they become large inflamed bumps a stronger form called accutane is used for severe acne it s a highly effective pill but it can cause serious side effects including depression and birth defects so the government regulates its use intensely focused light and lasers can also help fight acne when other treatments fail kim is also a researcher at ucla in the room dedicated to light and laser therapy kim points out what appears to be a half cylinder with stacks of oblong light bulbs patients with acne can go right under blue light and they sit there for about       minutes and acne often improves after several treatments kim says it s not known exactly how light therapy works to fight acne but kim says studies indicate it destroys the bacteria probably physically without giving it time to mutate and the other thing the light treatment can improve the inflammation that the bacteria causes in acne she says but laser and light therapy doesn t work for everyone it s expensive and typically not covered by insurance so kim and colleagues at the university of pittsburgh are also looking into an entirely new way to fight acne taking a harmless virus that lives on the skin and programming it to become a bacteria killer the virus is going to go and kill the bacteria that causes acne it s just going to break it apart and burst its membrane so there s no time for the bacteria to mutate she says it s sort of a surprise attack the approach is a promising way to get rid of acne without using antibiotics if further lab studies prove successful researchers will begin testing on people to see if viral therapy is both safe and effective in fighting acne as acne bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic treatments  doctors turn to zit fighting viruses  as acne bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic treatments  doctors turn to zit fighting viruses ',\n",
       " 'part   introduction one of the most profitable schemes ever devised to deprive the gullible of their money must be the sale of bottled water in the western world tap water is about as safe as it can be and it is relatively cheap yet many people are prepared to pay up to       times as much when the same stuff comes in a bottle in this paper we will consider this phenomenon the bottled water boom was indeed an unlikely phenomenon perhaps the strangest thing about it was that this bland commodity made its impact in britain at the height of a recession and with raging inflation there was a general lack of money in people s pockets yet bottled water became an overnight success strange too is the fact that present water companies boast of the purity of their product when the various impurities that mineral waters contain used to be the whole point of buying the stuff anyway natural water is never purer than when it falls on the hills as rain once it hits the ground however all that changes seeping into the soil it moves underground through passages and caverns carved over the millennia eating away at the rock and dissolving metals salts and minerals along the way as it goes its character changes depending on the type of rock through which it passes eventually it arrives in underground lakes or aquifers the sources of most bottled mineral waters throw out the bath water since roman times bath spa in britain has been a centre renowned for its mineral springs and baths little has changed since roman times bath spring waters have always had a reputation for health giving properties because of their natural origins but merely because they are natural and come from underground does not mean that they are safe to drink a study carried out by the university of wales found elevated amounts of several elements regarded as poisonous in the water bath s waters come up from some    miles below the surface on their way they absorb quantities of fluoride and sulphates well beyond the safety limits set for tap water it s the water which is good for you it is usually better to keep the minerals out the minerals can often do harm over the past half century there has been a distinct shift of opinion until the second world war the waters of bath were advertised and promoted on the amount of radioactivity they contained people believed that radioactivity was health promoting they don t believe that now and the radioactivity of bath s spring water isn t mentioned today travelling through the ground as it does bath s water picks up more than minerals in      a girl swimming in a pool dived down to where the source water was coming in and swallowed some of it five days later she died of amoebic meningitis tests showed that the amoeba was in the water and the pool was closed the fad in the bottle by the     s people had stopped taking the waters the fashion had faded and the days of health giving spring waters appeared to be over but an advertising campaign by the french company perrier in      was to bring about a dramatic change the financial times in an article on the mineral and spring waters market called the campaign a waste of time because bottled waters it said would be drunk only by cranks and foreigners how wrong they were bottled water has become an extraordinary success story sales of bottled water totalled   million litres in      in just one decade that figure rose to     million litres and by      some     million bottles of mineral water were drunk in britain alone wenche marshall foster chairman and chief executive of perrier uk predicts that the market will rise to one billion litres a year by the turn of the century a survey of     people from london and the midlands published in      found that a quarter of them never drank water directly from the tap perrier has been joined by many other companies eager to cash in on the trend there are now     producers of bottled water in britain from large hi tech bottling factories to small unsophisticated ones in garden sheds all are attempting to cash in on the   million a day uk market but the market is still dominated by the big names and supermarkets own brands perrier owns buxton water contrex volvic vichy saint yorre and others scotland s highland spring which is owned by a consortium registered in liechtenstein bottles for tesco sainsbury s and the co op the image whatever the brand name the image they project is the same cleanliness purity and health to sell a commodity at a high price to people who can get it for next to nothing out of the tap the image is all important and not always realistic buxton water is advertised on television and the bottle with pictures of the beautiful derbyshire landscape the water is bottled in an industrial estate next to a busy railway yard glyndwr spring water on the other hand is bottled by hand in a portacabin in a field where they are bottled does not mean that they are necessarily contaminated but neither does it mean that they are necessarily safe to drink what is important is what is happening on the catchment area from which the water is taken water is water what gives the different bottled waters their particular characteristics is the minerals and chemicals that they pick up in their passage through the ground and they will pick up any and all most of the water is taken from a rural environment this means that to be safe to drink what happens on the earth through which they flow must be strictly controlled for example cattle and other animals excrete waste material ground around springs should not be used for grazing over large areas there should be no pesticides or herbicides used do these areas get the degree of control they need nobody knows there is no information although all bottled waters are believed to be from natural springs some are not some are from the same surface water sources as the local tap water and some are tap water marwin uk ltd based in a manchester industrial estate markets a bottled water called purefect    this comes straight out of a tap from the manchester main water supply and is then purified further by the company purefect    is not spring water but it is probably one of the cleanest and purest bottled waters on the market because the company s purification is in addition to all the checks cleaning and treating that the regulations demand of its public supply source purefect    s label proclaims purefect    is produced here in manchester from upland water sources utilising the latest treatment techniques it is purified by a series of specialised processes which remove unwanted or potentially harmful chemicals giving you a wholesome water for all your drinking and culinary requirements with no minerals no organic or inorganic chemicals and no bacteria in it marwin can claim with justification that it is the best bottled water you can buy purefect    is not the only bottled tap water in the south crystal spring is bottled from london s tap water and the soft drinks giant schweppes is planning to bottle tap water in britain just as coca cola and pepsi cola already do in the usa the bbc  consumer programme watchdog looked at designer waters on    september      the programme concentrated on crystal spring which is made in the basement of a london restaurant and which sells for   a bottle in around two hundred other restaurants they found that the only differences between crystal spring and the london tap water from which it is made were slightly raised levels of copper and zinc and because the chlorine had been removed bacteria levels        times higher crystal spring may still be safe to drink despite these high levels but it cannot be as safe as the original tap water a

arrange a public speaking engagement apparently speaking in public is a fear greater than death for some people this is one fear that everyone can conquer why let something simple shackle you the key is to just do it your local toastmasters club would be happy to help   audition for a role in a play give your creative side a chance to come alive in the theater were you in a high school production why not give it a try again you might rediscover something about yourself that has been suppressed   read a book with an opposing view we can all get set in our ways and our limited view of the world pick up a book at your local library that purports a view that is contrary to one that you hold dear read it from cover to cover and try to keep an open mind note points that make some sense and ponder them   change jobs i run into people all the time that seem to hate their jobs but they won t go out and find a better one don t stay stuck in a rut any longer take a step today toward finding

a great way to give yourself a new challenge while also expanding your opportunities    introduce yourself to a complete stranger for some this is no big deal but for others of us this is not something that comes easily set a goal to meet five new people this week what s the worst that can happen you might make a connection that will blossom into a fruitful relationship    attend a service at the church of your choice are you attending to your spiritual needs if not maybe it is time for you to seek out a place of worship not sure where to go i would suggest asking a friend if you can accompany them it will make their day    sit alone in complete silence for an hour this one sounds simple enough but give it a try it is harder than you think we are so accustomed to noise and to being in the presence of others that you might initially find this very challenging my guess is that if you do it for a few days that it will become something you love    move to a new home find a new place to live in a different city or at least on the other side of town a move will force you out of your ruts you will have to develop new routines and explore a new area this will give you a chance

creatures get out there and see something new a trip like this is dangerous because it could change your entire life    fly down a zip line taking a zip line tour is a rush it will definitely get your adrenaline flowing i did this when i went to puerto vallarta mexico earlier this year the zip line was total fun this type of thrill seeking awakens your adventurous spirit    organize a reunion reach out to some people that you haven t seen in awhile this could be family classmates or just an old friend that you haven t talked to in years reminiscing about the past might stir up old ideas in you that you forgot you had    write something and get it published writing is a terrific way to express yourself and tap into your creativity getting what you write published will give you a sense of accomplishment you will also probably get quite a nice boost from the positive reviews that you ll receive there is no excuse for remaining in your present rut a new challenge will energize you and give you the courage to continue to grow we only have one life to live and you do not want to waste another day go stretch yourself outside your comfort zone what other ways are there to get out of

chemistry wanted to find the perfect gravy recipe as part of their      year of food project they went to yorkshireman and chemist john emsley he uses all the elements of a traditional roast to make his gravy from the meat juices to the water the vegetables are boiled in which add nutrients as well as flavour the perfect way to do the sunday meal is with gravy from the joint why waste the nutrients he says start by cooking the joint on a bed of halved onions carrots and celery which juices from the meat will slowly trickle on to when the meat is cooked remove it from the roasting tin along with the vegetables sprinkle a small amount of plain flour over the meat juices and fat stir to form a dough or roux by gradually adding the water you ve boiled your accompanying vegetables in john says it works best with cabbage water if you boil things like cabbage you lose nutrients into the water using that water in the gravy adds an extra little depth it s a way of putting that back into the meal stir the gravy until all the meat juices and marmite like deposits on the bottom of the roasting dish have dissolved add iodised salt to taste and a teaspoon of soy sauce perhaps a surprising addition soy sauce is a crucial ingredient because it reaches our fifth taste what the japanese call umami simmer to reduce the liquid to the right consistency stirring occasionally and then pour all over your traditional roast souffl penny lewis who runs cookery courses at the culinary cottage near abergavenny south wales which deal with supposedly tricky dishes is confident that anyone can make a souffl that is lovely and light most people are just frightened of it she says you do need a good whisk and a clean bowl have it all in place before you start and the oven at the right temperature having the right equipment and ingredients to hand is important so you can time it right preheat the oven to    c generously butter a   cm souffl dish and coat with finely grated parmesan separate four large eggs melt   g butter in a saucepan stir in   g of plain flour half a teaspoon of mustard and a pinch of cayenne pepper cook for a minute or two remove from the heat and stir in    ml of full fat milk return it to the heat whisking until thickened and continue to cook for a few minutes while continually whisking remove from the heat then stir in between   g and    g of either strong cheddar or gruy re cheese followed by the egg yolks and salt and pepper whisk the egg whites in a very clean bowl until they are stiff but not dry gently fold in the cheese mixture with a metal spoon and pour into a souffl dish run your thumb around the top edge of the dish for the top hat effect suggests penny bake for    to    minutes until it is golden brown and well risen to check if your souffl is ready open the oven door slightly but not before    minutes has elapsed and give the dish a gentle shove if it just wobbles it s ready if it is very wobbly allow five more minutes but the real key to souffl success is to eat it quickly penny s final rule make sure your guests are at the table and ready to eat when you get your souffl out of the oven basmati rice rice is one of those basic accompaniments that we should all be able to manage yet it so often ends up sticky we turned to michelin starred chef alfred prasad from indian restaurant tamarind for his approach it s very easy he says this method applies to all good quality rice first measure your rice in a liquid measurement say    ml alfred insists that soaking the rice a process we might be tempted to skip is really important grains of rice rub against each in the packet which produces a starchy powder and soaking gets rid of that he says after    to    minutes drain and then rinse the rice two or three times until it is no longer milky measure your water using double the quantity of rice one litre of water for    ml of rice use a vessel at least twice its volume and put the water on to boil as soon as the water is boiling turn down the heat and throw in the soaked rinsed rice people do use salt but it s really not required says alfred another useful tip which probably won t go down well with the healthy eating brigade is to add a teaspoon of vegetable oil to keep the rice from sticking stir the rice a couple of times to stop it from clumping at the bottom alfred recommends using a spatula rather than a spoon and bring it back to the boil once you get to the point when there is no more moisture on the top of the rice but while it is still fairly wet at the bottom turn the heat off he says alfred then leaves the pan open without a lid so that all the excess steam can clear leave for    minutes then transfer to your serving dish meringues we all dream of fluffy cloud like creations with outer crunch and inner goo but may find ourselves brought back down to earth with browned flattened lumps lynn bolton has mastered the art and has up a mail order meringue company head in the clouds dedicated to selling her confections she shares her secrets for the classic meringue nest ensure you have clean bowls and equipment any grease will deflate the meringue she says my nan taught me to wipe out the bowls and the equipment with vinegar pre heat the oven to    c you need    g of egg whites at room temperature and    g of good quality white caster sugar if your eggs weigh in at    g or    g don t worry just double this weight for the sugar content says lynn meringues are pure chemistry sugar and egg white in a ratio of   to   weigh the egg white as well as the sugar you can t go wrong put the egg whites and sugar in a heat proof bowl stir to remove any lumps and place over a saucepan of just boiling water make sure the bottom of the basin does not touch the water leave over the water for around eight to    minutes stirring occasionally and checking that the sugar has melted transfer to a mixing bowl to whisk set a timer for    minutes using an electric whisk beat for five minutes and then add seeds scraped from one vanilla pod and a few drops of vanilla essence continue beating and feel the bowl as you go it will cool as the air is beaten into the mixture after eight minutes take the beaters out of the meringue and see if it holds its shape if it isn t stiff then beat for a further two minutes and test again before using the mixture don t over beat the meringue it should be glossy like a gloss paint and not dull says lynn transfer the meringue mix on to a large lined baking tray quickly work the meringue mixture into a round approximately    mm circumference so it is still nice and deep says lynn and make a shallow well in the middle put into the preheated oven and then immediately turn the temperature down to    c cook for three hours check that the meringue is firm on the base by gently easing it off the tray and tapping it if at any point you think the meringue is going to give stop and cook for a further    minutes once you are happy that it sounds dull this means it is still gooey inside and the base is firm turn the oven off pastry some of us might reach for the ready made stuff out of the supermarket freezer section but gerhard jenne of london based bakers konditor cook insists that making sweet pastry is literally as easy as one two three the recipe we use is very basic it s the       method one part sugar two parts butter and three parts flour you don t even need scales if you want to make it a bit finer you could also add an egg yolk says gerhard the most important thing is the sugar itself he says never use granulated sugar it s too coarse and can taste a bit gritty when you bake it the grains go splodgy he recommends using good caster sugar or for a really fine pastry icing sugar pastry is never going to be a health food and gerhard refuses to skimp on the salt suggesting that you should add it or use salted butter to bring out the flavour if you re using egg yolk start with the sugar and yolk add the grease and then the flour you can mix it by hand which gerhard insists is quite easy to do although they use a food processor it comes together fairly quickly but once it is together you don t want to overwork it do it fairly speedily says gerhard once you ve got a nice dough don t mess about wrap it in clingfilm and pop it in the fridge to chill for half an hour once you ve taken it out of the fridge knead it or work it over a couple of times it won t need much pastry is pretty pliable then roll it out with as little flour as possible you don t want a residue it won t look very nice he adds a common problem with pastry that often it is not cooked properly gerhard recommends quite a hot oven of between    c and    c depending on the size of your dish cook it until it is golden there s nothing worse than undercooked pale pastry it s a bit insipid white sauce a white sauce or bchamel to give it its more intimidating name is the classic base for many a sauce top chef paul gayler whose book sauce is dedicated to the art of making a great sauce tells us how to get it lump free start by halving a small onion and stud each half with two cloves place in a pan with    ml of full fat milk and a small bay leaf the onion cloves and bay leaf infuse the milk making it aromatic says paul bring the milk to the boil and simmer gently for four to five minutes in another pan make a roux begin by melting   g of butter and add   g of plain flour cook for    to    seconds stirring frequently until the roux is pale yellow make sure you have equal amounts of butter and flour so you

wooden spoon to stir it gives it a lovely silky appearance and you can slap the sauce up against the sides says paul slowly bring the bchamel to the boil reduce the heat and then simmer it for

       " 'a new survey of american voters shows that fox news viewers are significantly more misinformed than consumers of news from other sources december         yet another study has been released proving that watching fox news is detrimental to your intelligence world public opinion a project managed by the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland conducted a survey of american voters that shows that fox news viewers are significantly more misinformed than consumers of news from other sources what s more the study shows that greater exposure to fox news increases misinformation so the more you watch the less you know or to be precise the more you think you know that is actually false this study corroborates a previous pipa study that focused on the iraq war with similar results and there was an nbc wall street journal poll that demonstrated the break with reality on the part of fox viewers with regard to health care the body of evidence that fox news is nothing but a propaganda machine dedicated to lies is growing by the day in eight of the nine questions below fox news placed first in the percentage of those who were misinformed they placed second in the question on tarp that s a pretty high batting average for journalistic fraud here is a list of what fox news viewers believe that just aint so    percent believe the stimulus legislation lost jobs    percent believe the health reform law will increase the deficit    percent believe the economy is getting worse    percent believe climate change is not occurring    percent believe income taxes have gone up    percent believe the stimulus legislation did not include any tax cuts    percent believe obama initiated the gm chrysler bailout    percent believe that most republicans opposed tarp    percent believe obama was not born in the u s or that it is unclear the conclusion is inescapable fox news is deliberately misinforming its viewers and it is doing so for a reason every issue above is one in which the republican party had a vested interest the gop benefited from the ignorance that fox news helped to proliferate the results were apparent in the election last month as voters based their decisions on demonstrably false information fed to them by fox news by the way the rest of the media was not blameless cnn and the broadcast network news operations fared only slightly better in many cases even msnbc which had the best record of accurately informing viewers has a ways to go before it can brag about it the conclusions in this study need to be disseminated as broadly as possible fox s competitors need to report these results and produce ad campaigns featuring them newspapers and magazines need to publish the study across the country this is big news and it is critical that the nation be advised that a major news enterprise is poisoning their minds this is not an isolated review of fox s performance it has been corroborated time and time again the fact that fox news is so blatantly dishonest and the effects of that dishonesty have become ingrained in an electorate that has been been purposefully deceived needs to be made known to every american our democracy cannot function if voters are making choices based on lies we have the evidence that fox is tilting the scales and we must now make certain its corporate owners do not get away with it mark howard is an artist and author and the publisher of news corpse alternet org  independent media  alternative news  media activism  the drug war a new survey of american voters shows that fox news viewers are significantly more misinformed than consumers of news from other sources ',\n",

       " 'throughout this season and beyond you re gonna hear me talking a lot about the glove trick some of you already know about this but for those who don t here s the story when i was eight i saw a fan on tv using a fishing pole to lower an empty soup can over a ball that was sitting beyond his reach on the field below the can descended slowly slowly until it dropped over the ball and when the guy lifted it the ball was gone poof just like that i couldn t believe it and the memory stuck six years later i started attending games regularly and began to drool over all the balls that rolled into the left field corner during batting practice at yankee stadium i tried to make my own can but it was clunky and rarely worked when i practiced with it at home i brought it to one game in      but bp was wiped out by a last minute thunderstorm and i gave up on the idea the following season inspiration struck instead of a can with sharp edges and three pound dumbbells tied to the top all i needed was my glove a rubber band a sharpie and some string i practiced in my room and the thing worked it was easy to set up and didn t require materials that might be confiscated i started getting more baseballs than ever fans always asked how i did it players often came over for a look this is what they all wanted to know   the materials tie the string to the handle of your glove and keep it tucked away in the palm when you re not using it it s a bit uncomfortable at first but you ll get used to it   hook the band under the flap on the outside of your glove s pocket if there s no flap you have two choices improvise or get a new glove   stretch the band over the tip of your glove and prop the glove open with the sharpie without the sharpie the glove won t stay open normal pens don t work as well because they re thin and sometimes slip through the spaces between the fingers when you have everything set up the space between the band and the tip of the glove needs to be slightly smaller than the ball   lower your glove over the ball at this point you ll be dangling the glove by the string i m just holding the glove itself so i could take a decent pic anyway the glove s weight forces the band to stretch around the ball but first make sure that the band is not too tight or the ball won t go in or too loose or the ball won t stay in this takes practice alliance s size    b rubber bands work best for me   it s a delicate operation lift the glove slowly so the ball doesn t fall out this is the view from below complete with the ceiling light in the hallway outside my apartment notice how the band has stretched back to hold the ball in place a few years ago rick reilly named this trick the zacktrap in a story for sports illustrated and rosie o donnell had me perform it live on her show good times yes but i ve also gotten a few lectures along the way from stadium security some ballparks don t allow these kinds of contraptions others have no problem with them and a few have policies that fall somewhere in the middle for example when i visited oakland in      security allowed the fans to fish for balls behind the outfield walls but wouldn t let us pluck them off the field it s hard to keep track of the rules especially when they vary from one usher to the next so be careful and respectful and ask for permission first oh and don t tell anyone how the trick works it s a secret ',\n",

       " 'today s breakfast recipe and macronutrient breakdown below you have to laugh in today s world of industrially engineered food and drink the term energy drink is merely euphemism for sugar drink yea some are laced with caffein for added energy and naturally engineering being what it is you don t even have to look to know that cans of that crap probably contain upwards of   teaspoons and more of sugar in a single can there are   grams in a tsp of sugar all carbohydrate so an energy drink sporting    grams of rapidly assimilating carbohydrate in liquid form is about     teaspoons now let me ask a dumb question how many of you would put   teaspoons of sugar into any    or    oz unsweetened drink anyway enough of that nonsense as anyone with an ounce of true nutritional sense knows fat is the ultimate source of energy both dietary and body fat it s simple a gram of carbohydrate like sugar or hfcs has   kilocalories of energy while a gram of fat has   more than twice as much gram for gram but there s one kind of fat that s a bit special medium chain triglyceride mct what s special about it mcts passively diffuse from the gi tract to the portal system longer fatty acids are absorbed into the lymphatic system without requirement for modification like long chain fatty acids or very long chain fatty acids in addition mcts do not require bile salts for digestion patients that have malnutrition or malabsorption syndromes are treated with mcts because they do not require energy for absorption utilization or storage coconut oil is composed of approximately    medium chain triglycerides other rich sources of mcts include palm kernel oils and camphor tree drupes the fatty acids found in mcts are called medium chain fatty acids you usually have to dig a bit if you don t already know to discover that these mcts are saturated fats or should i say arterycloggingsaturatedfat another thing to note is that they digest rapidly like sugar in a drink and so are truly in the category of supplying rapid energy the whole point of an energy drink or glucose gel such as endurance athletes use but guess what little to no glycemic load they don t spike your blood sugar to significant degree and thus don t spike your insulin significantly leaving you to later need another energy drink and another and another peak valley peak valley wash rinse repeat there s more turns out that mcts have other huge benefits in terms of blood sugar control in diabetics as well as actual fat loss yea a fat that makes you lose body fat let s take a look at what the scientistas have to say pubmed greater rise in fat oxidation with medium chain triglyceride consumption relative to long chain triglyceride is associated with lower initial body weight and greater loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue conclusion these data suggest that shunting of dietary fat towards oxidation results in diminished fat storage as reflected by the loss of bw and subcutaneous adipose tissue furthermore mct consumption may stimulate ee and fat oxidation to a lower extent in men of greater bw compared to men of lower bw indicative of the lower responsiveness to a rapidly oxidized fat by overweight men this was a randomized crossover controlled feeding trail subjects got either high amounts of mct or lct olive oil crossover means that each group was subjected to both diets which is gold standard those on mct lost almost twice as much fat as those on lct sciencedirect medium chain triglycerides abstract chemical and physical properties of mcfas show substantial metabolic differences mcfas do not require binding to proteins such as fatty acid binding protein fatty acid transport protein and or fatty acid translocase fat homolog to human platelet cd   mcfas are a preferred source of energy   oxidation mcfas are also incorporated into adipose tissue triglycerides and may influence adipose tissue and other systemic functions more substantially than previously assumed mcts reduce fat mass through down regulation of adipogenic genes as well as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor   recent studies confirmed the potential of mcfas to reduce body weight and particularly body fat this effect was not transient mcfas reduce lipoprotein secretion and attenuate postprandial triglyceride response it was however frequently observed that mcts increase fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels but given in moderate amounts in diets with moderate fat supply mcfas may actually reduce fasting lipid levels more than oils rich in mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids the same is true for glucose levels mcts improved several features contributing to enhanced insulin sensitivity under certain in vitro conditions mcts exert proinflammatory effects but in vivo mcts may reduce intestinal injury and protect from hepatotoxicity this is just a review article looking at studies demonstrating a lot of the benefits of mcts that we re talking about do note the warning siren about elevated fasting cholesterol and triglycerides of course this is just the abstract such that some news media regurgitator in the health section can write a dumbshit headline like coconut milk raises cholesterol levels study finds then you tear into the full text and find it wasn t significant it was one poorly controlled study out of many or some other bs and who cares about cholesterol numbers anyway cool that it may also may aid intestinal repair and protect your liver from drug or alcohol induced toxicity important for those on medications or who drink regularly more hell i don t do science that often anymore so let s go all out but in consideration of the environment let s save some space and you can click over to the abstracts you want to read pubmed physiological effects of medium chain triglycerides potential agents in the prevention of obesity pubmed medium chain fatty acid metabolism and energy expenditure obesity treatment implications pubmed medium chain fatty acids as metabolic therapy in cardiac disease the heart muscle loves ketone bodies i ve heard ed pubmed medium chain fatty acids functional lipids for the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome well here s one from      that bears quoting the entire abstract especially in view of the recipe for my secret energy drink below pubmed medium chain triglycerides mct in aging and arteriosclerosis abstract some of the nutritional work with triglycerides consisting mainly of c  and c   fatty acids mct lends itself to speculations about their influence on arteriosclerosis arteriosclerosis is thought to be part of the normal aging process which is due to age associated molecular biological changes the lipid theory of arteriosclerosis is rejected pertinent studies with mct include these observations feeding of mct to rats resulted in animals of low body weight small fat deposits and excellent survival rate this deserves emphasis because of the beneficial influence of low body weight on aging and arteriosclerosis mct feeding was associated with low linoleate and low tocopherol requirements in rats this may lead to reduced formation of those linoleate derived prostaglandins which favor thrombosis formation lower linoleate requirements may also lead to the presence of fewer uncontrolled free radicals in the cells mct feeding is associated with low levels of serum and liver cholesterol involving speculations that tissue conditions are such that an adaptive increase of cholesterol is unnecessary the demographic yearbook of the united nations      reported that sri lanka has the lowest death rate from ischemic heart disease sri lanka is the only of the countries giving reliable data where coconut oil containing over    medium chain fatty acids is the main dietary fat emphasis added so while it doesn t say how much saturated fat the lowest death rate from heart disease sri lankans ate we do have an idea for another population the tokelauans who eat about    of energy from saturated fat and have no evidence of heart disease i blogged about it way back here there was one other issue i wanted to cover and that s the potential insulin stimulating effects of mcts if any and whether coconut milk with   gram of carbohydrate per ounce could present any problem to diabetics i dug all over the place got lots of help from twitter peeps thanks much all of you but in the end could not really come to firm conclusions so i ll leave that to comments other than that there s this interesting conversation between marty gallagher and dr chris hardy at precisionnutrition on mcts coconut oil and coconut milk in both a health and training context good stuff alright now while i certainly didn t need to do all this sciency researchin to know that a natural product like coconut milk would be like most wholesome food good for me i want to make sure you have confidence dear reader that indeed it is safe to go back in the water the sharks are all over at jamba juice getting their faux health smoothies count how many of those sugar drinks have over    g of sugar nope what you ll get here is a smoothie an energy drink that will blow the lid off all that crap in a cup in terms of sustained level energy and satiation and well you ve seen the potential numerous health and weight loss and control benefits incidentally coconut fat is about    saturated of the saturated fat    is comprised of mcts and by the way i ve used both coconut oil and coconut milk in cooking for years particularly for thai curries also last year at novnat over a week we probably each had near or more than a can of coconut milk every morning see the top pic and i for one was rarely ever hungry much for lunch in spite of the activity though i ate big every meal and i lost   pounds over the week and felt great alright the recipe   cup full fat coconut milk i like native forrest     cup water   raw egg yolks don t eat whites raw cook them to destroy avidin an anti nutrient   scoop whey protein i use vanilla primal fuel     cup frozen berries i like the medleys blend it and consume i save the whites scramble them in a pat of butter and add a bit of grated parmesan for flavor no salt macronutrient breakdown total fat    grams saturated fat    grams      of total fat carbohydrate    grams protein    grams total calories     percent total energy    tf    sfa    c    p an alternative which i ll try is to do one raw egg yolk in the smoothie and mix the white with the other whole egg for cooking and of course there s tons of variations you can do with this the egg yolks make it smooth the frozen berries make it cool without making it watery with ice and so on and so on you might also like thai coconut milk ginger soup with shrimp mushrroms guest

       " 'summer seems to finally be here june in new england was literally a washout but the sun came out for the fourth of july holiday while it hasn t exactly been beach weather lately it hopefully will be very soon this means of course that a person needs to have a beach ready body right most of us know that losing weight and staying fit and managing diabetes requires a certain measure of discipline to choose the right foods in the right amounts and to stay active on a fairly regular basis but it s hard and temptations sometimes get in the way of good intentions when s that magic pill coming it may not be here yet but what about all those fat burning foods we hear and read about is there something to them let s find out vinegarvinegar is acidic so it can be irritating to the mouth throat and stomach if ingested in too high a quantity but it has its benefits vinegar is thought to help slow the rise in blood glucose after a meal essentially lowering the glycemic index of a meal and it may also help with blood pressure control it used to be one of those old wives tales swallow a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before your meals and you ll rev up your metabolism vinegar supposedly helps curb appetite and cut cravings but until lately there was no credible research proving any of this however japanese scientists have found that there may actually be something to vinegar and weight loss the researchers gave two groups of mice white vinegar in various concentrations via a stomach tube and gave another group of mice water both groups were fed a high fat diet the vinegar fed mice had    less body fat than the water fed mice vinegar contains acetic acid which may turn on genes that signal the body to break down fat preventing it from accumulating in body tissue should you take vinegar for weight loss it s hard to say it s certainly fine to use vinegar as a marinade or in salad dressings if you decide to try it before meals dilute it with some water to reduce possible irritation spicy foodsdo you love hot spicy dishes is tabasco sauce one of your must have condiments if so you may be in luck with regard to your metabolism that is some studies show that eating foods seasoned with chili pepper or black pepper can boost metabolism by up to    when you eat a spicy dish your body generates more heat which in turn helps burn calories but unless you eat spicy foods constantly and maybe you do the amount of calories that you actually burn may be negligible and the effect on metabolism only lasts for about    minutes however spicy foods may offer another benefit making you feel more full in fact in one study men who were fed appetizers seasoned with hot sauce before eating a meal ate about     fewer calories than men who didn t eat the hot sauce the researchers think that the sauce which contained capsaicin the chemical that makes certain peppers hot helped to blunt their appetites so spice up your meals with some red pepper flakes hot sauce or even ginger but be careful if you have heartburn as these spices may aggravate the condition green teagreen tea has received a lot of press over the past few years particularly in the realm of helping to fight heart disease and some types of cancer green tea is rich in certain polyphenols types of antioxidants called catechins that have anti inflammatory and anticancer properties but green tea may do more than fight disease some evidence shows that drinking green tea may also help with weight loss in one study japanese men were given oolong tea infused with green tea extract a control group drank oolong tea without green tea extract after three months those who drank the green tea extract lost an average of     pounds while those who didn t drink the extract lost only     pounds and in research looking at mice prone to obesity those who ate food containing green tea extract gained less weight and body fat it may be that the catechins in the green tea increase thermogenesis or the burning of calories as body heat at any rate if you re thinking of trying green tea to help with your weight be prepared to drink between   to   cups of it each day eggsok eggs don t have magical fat burning properties although to be honest not many foods actually do but a study published last year in the international journal of obesity showed that men and women who ate two eggs for breakfast as part of a lower calorie diet lost    more weight and had a    greater reduction in their waist circumference than men and women who ate a bagel for breakfast the secret eggs very likely increased satiety a feeling of fullness so that folks ended up eating less i ve mentioned eggs in previous postings they can be part of pretty much anyone s eating plan so maybe there aren t any foods that will melt away the fat but the foods i ve mentioned above can certainly be part of an eating plan geared to help you lose and maintain a healthy weight diabetes  fat burners  can

for reasons not wholly understood more effective in men than in women young men in fact may have up to    to    percent greater enzyme activity in the presence of alcohol but men s ad effectiveness also drops off with age at a faster rate than in women such that by around    or    men may find themselves able to handle less alcohol than their female counterparts all other factors being equal a full stomach helps break down alcohol but not because your food soaks up the alcohol when you eat a big meal your stomach s pyloric sphincter a kind of release valve into the small intestine closes tightly your body knows that you ve got food that should get a good going over in your stomach before it heads straight to the high absorption small intestine so it keeps it there and the ad in your stomach has more time to work on the alcohol drink on an empty stomach and the liquid quickly makes it into the small intestine where there s more than     square meters of surface area for absorption into your body image via peretzpup another big factor in alcohol absorption and alcohol s effects is genetics your great great grandparents have a say in how buzzed your friday night gets for sure but for roughly one third to half of asian drinkers it s more than a slight variance alcohol flush reaction a flushing of the face when drinking occurs because the enzyme clean up crew aldehyde dehydrogenase is mutated by just one amino acid that changes how effective its molecules are in bonding with and busting up acetaldehyde with excess acetaldehyde in their system those with a flush reaction get red faced and can experience heart palpitations dizziness and severe nausea in extreme cases your own genetic makeup of ad and aldehyde dehydrogenase affect your ability to break down alcohol and its byproducts in similar fashion don t take aspirin before drinking unless you love hangovers aspirin seriously cuts the effectiveness of your body s ad enzymes in one      study the average blood alcohol levels of those who took two maximum strength aspirin tablets before drinking were an average of    percent higher than those who were aspirin free other studies have suggested even more impact on your body s ability to break down alcohol that also means more acetaldehyde in your system down the line so you ll learn your lesson quickly if you re considering aspirin as a helper side note absorption and elimination is a curve not a straight line think you ve got a handle on the basic one drink per hour algorithm for your weekend nights check out this explainer from a forensic toxicology lab which also links up an advanced blood alcohol calculator your bac moves through plateaus responds differently to drinks higher than       percent alcohol by volume and eliminates some alcohol in pure form which is how police can measure it on your breath it extends your life kind of every few weeks it seems a new study suggests a glass of wine or sometimes any old drink lengthens your life if you don t overdo it plucking just one out of the pile you ll see that in alcoholism clinical and experimental research researchers followed      people over a total of    years as they aged between    and    of those who abstained entirely    percent died among those who drank in moderate amounts    percent died which was    percent less than the light drinkers even heavy drinkers fared better than abstainers with just    percent passing away during the study period how could a substance that everybody and their five brothers tell you to go easy on extend your life popular theories center on the antioxidants and resveratrol compounds found in wines or on the studies showing alcohol as increasing levels of hdl good cholesterol but jonah lehrer at wired points out the not so obvious the link between a longer life and alcohol may not be direct but it s likely very real it relates to the long term benefits of reducing stress as well as alcohol s role in facilitating get togethers and acting as a social lubricant what does this have to do with longevity in recent years sociologists and epidemiologists have begun studying the long term effects direct pdf link of loneliness it turns out to be really dangerous we are social primates and when we re cut off from the social network we are more likely to die from just about everything but especially heart disease at this point the link between abstinence and social isolation is merely hypothetical but given the extensive history of group drinking it s what we do when we come together it seems likely that drinking in moderation makes it easier for us develop and nurture relationships and it s these relationships that help keep us alive image via linxbas theoretically then you might get some of the same benefits if you were a savvy social diet coke drinker but it s likely a combination of actual alcohol effects along with their social expressions that leads to study after study showing drinkers as getting some kind of life extending benefit it doesn t kill brain cells but does inhibit them it s true that at high concentrations like the nearly     percent pure alcohol used in sterilizing solutions alcohol can indeed kill cells and neurons and nearly anything else but given that the blood reaching your brain is only at      percent alcohol if you re legally intoxicated or say      percent if you ve just closed a major deal in tokyo it s not doing a lot of damage to your actual brain cells liver cells and other organs with long term chronic abuse are another matter don t believe it a major study by grethe jensen and colleagues in      matched brain samples taken from both alcoholics and nonalcoholics from groups of the two dead from non alcohol related causes there were no significant differences found in either the number or density of brain cells between the groups misconception junction tackles jensen s study and the topic in more depth what alcohol can and does do to your brain is affect the way your neurons get their firing triggers from glutamate it infiltrates the glutamate receptors in your synapses hurting their ability to send off their normal fire messages alcohol has this impact all across your brain the parts that control muscles speech coordination judgment and so on keep that in mind the next time you or someone else claims that they drive golf or otherwise perform some task better with alcohol s help as stephen braun puts it in buzz the science and lore of alcohol and caffeine substances such as cocaine and lsd work like pharmacological scalpels altering the functioning of only one or a handful of brain circuits alcohol is more like a pharmacological hand grenade it affects practically everything around it side note that s also why it uh inhibits sex the studies and implications are numerous to say the least but if you want a thumbnail understanding of how alcohol as shakespeare put it provokes the desire but takes away the performance it has to do with the firing of nerves in the brain and elsewhere that would relax the arteries enough to get both parties moving it s a bit more complex than that and drinking in moderation can be a net benefit in some cases but alcohol paradoxically doesn t help one specific region of your self to relax side note   alcohol is particularly effective at inhibiting memories like the sexual response the way the brain makes memories is far from comprehensively understood but it does seem linked to n methyl d aspartic acid or nmda the receptor for which alcohol seems particularly adept at interfering with according to braun studies have shown that while subjects under alcohol s influence can recall existing memories events happening during inebriation are regularly hard to remember it varies with the amount consumed and seems to top out at a serious     percent blood alcohol content but anything from flimsy recall to full on blackouts are possible due to alcohol s unique bond with the stuff that should make memories it makes other people seem more intentional if you d never been raised to think things through you d assume that most actions people took were fairly intentional and possibly pointed at causing you harm the same holds when people are asked to make snap judgments about things happening but give yourself any amount of time and you ll

personality and social psychology bulletin researchers detail a study with    men made to go three hours without food then given a shot of either juice or juice with more than a shot of pure alcohol all the glasses were rimmed with alcohol to mask the placebos the men thought they took part in a taste test then did unrelated tasks for    minutes after that they were asked to determine whether a series of deliberate accidental or vague stated actions he deleted the email she looked for her keys she tripped on the jump rope etc were deliberate or accidental ars technica sums up the results nearly all the participants no matter what condition judged all the unambiguous statements correctly however when the actions were ambiguous and could have been performed either intentionally or unintentionally the drunk participants were much more likely to perceive the actions as deliberate than the sober participants were the study showed that it didn t much matter whether a man thought he was drunk the jump to conclusions about an intention only took place when someone actually did have too much in them it s a terrible sleep aid ever heard the term nightcap people have long believed that alcohol helps you get to sleep and that part can be true for some once you re asleep though alcohol s interaction with your brain can lead to some fitful sleep and no sleep at all especially if you consumed caffeine anytime close to hitting the pillow image via ella s dad just as with caffeine your brain proves remarkably adept at adapting itself and responding to the ethanol molecules jamming up its receptors and interfering with neuron firings it takes a bit for the brain to catch up though and when your brain starts kicking in and reclaiming all its nooks and crannies it can wreak havoc on your crucial rem sleep along with your more passive general resting if you ve had caffeine too it s a drug that can take up to   hours to break down half a dose if it s in your system at the same time as your brain is trying to compensate for alcohol the combined revenge of both drugs can lead to some fairly restless sleep according to braun s buzz what aspect of alcohol do you

quite tangy but if you would prefer a milder flavour the tart will still turn out well if the amount of lemon juice in the filling is reduced to    ml     cup the filling is partially cooked on the stovetop before being oven baked in a precooked pastry case the buttery pastry can be difficult to work with if you don t wish to roll the pastry out or if it breaks when you are lifting it into the pan you can use your fingers to press the dough evenly over the base and up the side of the tart pan if desired the pastry case can be baked the day before filling and stored in an airtight container

medium speed for about    seconds until only tiny lumps of butter remain any butter pieces should be smaller than a grain of rice add the egg yolk to the processor and process on medium speed until the yolk is incorporated and the mixture just starts to clump together about       seconds during processing you may need to stop the machine and run a spatula around the side at the base of the bowl to dislodge any unincorporated ingredients remove the processor blade and use your hand to press the dough clumps together into a mass tip the dough onto a large sheet of baking paper the paper can be reused when rolling out the pastry use your hands to bring the pastry together into a smooth ball form the pastry into a disc shape wrap pastry disc with plastic wrap or place in a freezer bag and refrigerate for two to three hours after at least two hours resting time remove the pastry from the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature for       minutes until just soft enough to roll out the time required will depend on the temperature of the room adjust the oven rack to the lowest shelf position the pastry base will brown and crisp better if it is close to the bottom element if possible set your oven so that the top and bottom elements are on and the fan if present is off then preheat oven to     degrees celsius if you have a fan forced oven and aren t able to turn the fan off preheat your oven to     degrees celsius place unwrapped pastry disc between two large sheets of baking paper using a rolling pin roll pastry out to form a   cm diameter circle the pastry circle should be just large enough to line the pan if you make the circle much larger the pastry will be too thin when rolling the pastry out you may find that the edges of the pastry start to develop large cracks as in the photo below if this happens use your fingers to press the pastry back together to repair the cracks the bottom sheet of baking paper may develop creases during rolling these creases can make deep cuts in the pastry to help prevent this we do the following once or twice during rolling   leave the pastry between the two sheets of baking paper flip the paper and pastry over so the bottom sheet of baking paper is now on the top   lift the top sheet of baking paper off the pastry to remove the creases and then place the paper down again and continue rolling ensure the pastry shape is as round as possible if it isn t round the pastry may not completely line the pan once the pastry is rolled out to the desired size we briefly place it in the freezer to make it easier to work with and help prevent it from breaking when transferring to the pan we leave the pastry between the sheets of baking paper place it flat on a large tray board and put it in the freezer for     minutes to firm up exclusivelyfood com auwhen you are ready to transfer the pastry to the pan loosen the top sheet of baking paper by lifting it off the pastry and then placing it back down keeping the pastry between the two sheets of baking paper flip the paper and pastry over so the bottom sheet of paper is now on the top remove the top sheet of baking paper this process of loosening the paper makes it easier to lift the pastry off the baking paper when transferring the pastry to the pan you will need a  cm deep   cm base diameter loose bottomed tart pan if you have experience lining tart pans with pastry you can ignore the next paragraph the following instructions for lifting the pastry into the pan would probably suit left handed people so use the opposite sides hands if you prefer place the pan to the right of the pastry round with your left hand hold the rolling pin above the pastry work quickly to help prevent the pastry from breaking use the baking paper to lift the right side of the pastry up and drape it over the rolling pin leave the pastry resting on the rolling pin and return the baking paper in your hand to the bench slide your right hand between the pastry and baking paper still resting on the bench lift the pastry with your right hand and move the pastry to the left side of the tart pan when the pastry is in the correct position slide your right hand to the right using it to support the pastry as you roll it off the rolling pin and into the pan ease the pastry into the pan fold down any pastry that extends above the top rim of the pan and press it onto the edge crust to reinforce trim the edges of the pastry to neaten place pastry in freezer for    minutes scrunch one of the sheets of baking paper that you used when rolling the pastry until the paper is soft and pliable flatten the sheet of baking paper and use it to line the pastry case then half fill the case with raw rice dried beans or pie weights and gently push the rice weights up against the side of the case to support the edge crust place pan on the lowest oven rack and bake pastry for    minutes remove pastry from oven and carefully lift the baking paper and rice weights out of the pastry case return the pastry to the lowest oven rack and bake for about    minutes until a light golden colour place pan on a wire rack and allow pastry to cool for at least    minutes before starting filling fillingwhen ready to start the filling preheat oven to     degrees celsius     degrees celsius fan forced you will need a double boiler or a medium large saucepan and a large heatproof bowl that is wider than the saucepan one quarter fill the saucepan with water sit the bowl on top of the saucepan and check that the base of the bowl doesn t touch the water use a different bowl if necessary remove the bowl and bring the saucepan of water to the simmer place eggs in the bowl and lightly whisk with a fork or whisk to combine but not aerate add butter cream lemon juice and sugar to the bowl and use a heatproof spatula to stir to combine the butter won t combine with the other ingredients at this stage sit the bowl on top of the saucepan and stir the mixture constantly with the spatula scraping the base and side of the bowl to prevent the mixture sticking to the bowl and overcooking you may need to adjust the heat to keep the water at a simmer don t allow the water to boil continue stirring the mixture until it thickens slightly and a thin layer clings to the spatula about       minutes if you draw your finger across the spatula a clear trail should remain in the filling clinging to the spatula you will probably notice small white pieces of egg in the filling one such piece is shown on the spatula below strain the filling into the pastry case to remove the

steps may be helpful clean your skin washing with cleaning lotions and using oil removing pads can help control acne use acne fighting lotions lotions that contain niacinamide gel   and tea tree oil   can be helpful try zinc    to    mg a day of this mineral improves some people s acne add copper if taking extra zinc your body will need   to   mg each day of copper to avoid deficiency of this mineral these recommendations are not comprehensive and are not intended to replace the advice of your doctor or pharmacist continue reading the full acne vulgaris article for more in depth fully referenced information on medicines vitamins herbs and dietary and lifestyle changes that may be helpful about acne vulgaris acne vulgaris also known as common acne is an inflammatory condition of the sebaceous glands of the skin it consists of red elevated areas on the skin that may develop into pustules and even further into cysts that can cause scarring acne vulgaris occurs mostly on the face neck and back of most commonly teenagers and to a lesser extent of young adults the condition results in part from excessive stimulation of the skin by androgens male hormones bacterial infection of the skin also appears to play a role product ratings for acne vulgaris science ratings nutritional supplements herbs niacinamide topical zinc tea tree oil topical guggul pantothenic acid vitamin a vitamin b  burdock vitex associated with menstrual cycle see also homeopathic remedies for acne what are the symptoms acne is a skin condition characterized by pimples which may be closed sometimes called pustules or whiteheads or open blackheads on the face neck chest back and shoulders most acne is mild although some people experience inflammation with larger cysts which may result in scarring dietary changes that may be helpful many people assume certain aspects of diet are linked to acne but there is not much evidence to support this idea preliminary research found for example that chocolate was not implicated   similarly though a diet high in iodine can create an acne like rash in a few people this is rarely the cause of acne in a preliminary study foods that patients believed triggered their acne failed to cause problems when tested in a clinical setting   some doctors of natural medicine have observed that food allergy plays a role in some cases of acne particularly adult acne   however that observation has not been supported by scientific studies vitamins that may be helpful in a double blind trial topical application of a   niacinamide gel twice daily for two months resulted in significant in improvement in people with acne   however there is little reason to believe this vitamin would have similar actions if taken orally several double blind trials indicate that zinc supplements reduce the severity of acne       in one double blind trial   though not in another    zinc was found to be as effective as oral antibiotic therapy doctors sometimes suggest that people with acne take    mg of zinc two or three times per day for a few months then    mg per day thereafter it often takes    weeks before any improvement is seen long term zinc supplementation requires     mg of copper per day to prevent copper deficiency large quantities of vitamin a such as         iu per day for females and                 iu per day for males have been used successfully to treat severe acne    however unlike the long lasting benefits of the synthetic prescription version of vitamin a isotretinoin as accutane the acne typically returns several months after natural vitamin a is discontinued in addition the large amounts of vitamin a needed to control acne can be toxic and should be used only under careful medical supervision in a preliminary trial people with acne were given     grams of pantothenic acid orally four times per day for a total of    grams per day a remarkably high amount    a cream containing    pantothenic acid was also applied topically four to six times per day with moderate acne near complete relief was seen within two months while severe conditions took at least six months to respond eventually the intake of pantothenic acid was reduced to   to   grams per day still a very high amount a preliminary report suggested that vitamin b  at    mg per day may alleviate premenstrual flare ups of acne experienced by some women    while no controlled research has evaluated this possibility an older controlled trial of resistant adolescent acne found that        mg per day decreased skin oiliness and improved acne in    of the participants    however another preliminary report suggested that vitamin b  supplements might exacerbate acne vulgaris    are there any side effects or interactions refer to the individual supplement for information about any side effects or interactions herbs that may be helpful a clinical trial compared the topical use of   tea tree oil to   benzoyl peroxide for common acne although the tea tree oil was slower and less potent in its action it had far fewer side effects and was thus considered more effective overall    one controlled trial found that guggul commiphora mukul compared favorably to tetracycline in the treatment of cystic acne    the amount of guggul extract taken in the trial was     mg twice per day historically tonic herbs such as burdock have been used in the treatment of skin conditions these herbs are believed to have a cleansing action when taken internally    burdock root tincture may be taken in the amount of   to   ml per day dried root preparations in a capsule or tablet can be used at   to   grams three times per day many herbal preparations combine burdock root with other alterative herbs such as yellow dock red clover or cleavers in the treatment of acne none of these herbs has been studied in scientific research some older preliminary german research suggests that vitex might contribute to clearing of premenstrual acne possibly by regulating hormonal influences on acne    women in these studies used    drops of a concentrated liquid product once daily    are there any side effects or interactions refer to the individual herb for information about any side effects or interactions holistic approaches that may be helpful acupuncture may be helpful in the treatment of acne several preliminary studies have reported that a series of acupuncture treatments   to    is markedly effective or curative in    to    of patients        besides traditional chinese acupuncture using needles alone a technique called cupping is frequently used in the treatment of acne cupping refers to the use of cup shaped instruments to apply suction to the area being needled two preliminary trials of cupping treatment for acne reported marked improvement in    to    of the study participants      controlled trials are necessary to determine the true efficacy of acupuncture and other traditional chinese therapies in the treatment of acne some hypnotherapists believe that hypnosis might help prevent facial scarring associated with acne in one case study a patient was instructed to say the word scar in place of picking her face and the scratch marks

folly the life and breakthrough inventions of hedy lamarr the most beautiful woman in the world richard rhodes at the height of her hollywood career actress hedy lamarr was known as the most beautiful woman in the world for most of her life her legacy was her looks but in the     s in an attempt to help the war effort she quietly invented what would become the precursor to many wireless technologies we use today including bluetooth gps cellphone networks and more an unlikely beginning a new book by pulitzer prize winning author richard rhodes sets out to rewrite america s memory of lamarr hedy s folly the life and breakthrough inventions of hedy lamarr the most beautiful woman in the world chronicles her life and the inventive side that is not often mentioned rhodes tells rachel martin guest host of weekends on all things considered that lamarr had been fascinated with science as a child growing up in austria but pursued acting instead her first break into hollywood came when she heard louis mayer of metro goldwyn mayer studios was scouting for actors she went to see him in london he wasn t willing to offer her a very good deal so she said no and walked out having great confidence in herself rhodes says when lamarr found out mayer was headed back to the united states she bought a ticket for the same boat once she was aboard she found a way to make him long for her after all she was an actress and before the ship landed in new york she had a much much better contract the equivalent of about       a week for seven years he says within a year with the appearance of her in the film algiers opposite charles boyer she was a superstar un hollywood rhodes says lamarr was most often cast based on her looks and had few lines she quickly grew bored in hollywood hedy didn t drink she didn t like to party he says her idea of a good evening was a quiet dinner party with some intelligent friends where they could discuss ideas which sounds so un hollywood but hedy had to find something else to do to occupy her time rhodes says she had a drafting table installed in her house and started inventing among her projects was an improved stoplight and a tablet that when dissolved in water created a soda similar to coca cola she laughed later and said well it never really worked it probably tasted like an alka seltzer tablet which is basically what it was he laughs but she was constantly looking at the world and thinking well how could that be fixed how could that be improved enlarge random house richard rhodes is a journalist a historian and the author of more than    fiction and nonfiction books random house richard rhodes is a journalist a historian and the author of more than    fiction and nonfiction books inspired by war as she was inventing rhodes says lamarr was simultaneously glued to the events of world war ii when german submarines began targeting passenger cruise liners he says she felt compelled to invent something to help the allied cause she zeroed in on torpedoes which were powerful weapons but hard to control rhodes says she thought that if they could be radio guided there was a better chance they would hit their target she understood that the problem with radio signals was that they could be jammed but if you could make the signal hop around more or less randomly from radio frequency to radio frequency then the person at the other end trying to jam the signal won t know where it is he says if they try to jam one particular frequency it might hit that frequency on one of its hops but it would only be there for a fraction of a second thus her take on spread spectrum radio was born lamarr and her co inventor composer george antheil submitted their idea to the national inventor s council and received a patent for their secret communication system in      they were anxious to share their invention with the navy but got a lackluster response the navy being the navy if it hadn t been able to make a torpedo that worked obviously it wasn t going to be receptive to ideas coming in from outside rhodes says the navy basically threw it into the file untouched for years the navy classified the patent as top secret and it remained untouched for years but after world war ii the navy was interested in developing a so called sonobuoy that would use sonar to detect submarines in the water and transmit the information to an airplane above however it needed a way to jam proof the signal between the buoy and the plane they resuscitated the idea of frequency hopping and built it into the sonobuoy and after that the whole system just spread like wildfire rhodes says the military and private companies all started developing their own technologies around lamarr s invention today vestiges of her frequency hopping technique are found in most digital devices that communicate wirelessly but rhodes says lamarr s contribution was lost in the noise for decades in the     s when she was in her early   s one of the pioneers of wireless communications for computers came across lamarr s patent and realized she d never been honored he started the ball rolling so that one of the major communications organizations would give her one of its awards she by then had had so much bad plastic surgery that she didn t like to go out in public so she received the award by telephone he says when they called her up to tell her she would get the award her first words were hedy lamarr being hedy lamarr well it s about time one of the biggest actresses of mgm s golden age  also lived a quiet life as an

       " 'posted by ree in all pw recipes cowgirl food main courses pasta chick food alert this one s for the ladies gentlemen i say that because well there s no meat in it and i know there are some of you renaissance men out there who are not above eating a dinner wholly devoid of animal flesh but i sure don t know any of you so for my life this dish is poised right at the top of my list of chick foods which means i won t make it unless marlboro man is in china for the week it s pasta primavera which translates to spring pasta in english and the classic dish uses a mixture of bright green vegetables mixed with pasta as i sit typing this post in    degree weather i m well aware that it s no longer spring and really since many of the vegetables used in my recipe don t become ripe in my garden until at least the middle of july spring pasta really isn t a fitting name at all is there a pasta naming coalition who can hear my complaint is there a form i can fill out it s just that i believe calling it pasta primavera is really dishonest so is my suggestion that any of these vegetables came from my garden because they didn t but enough of my issues let s get on to the dish itself i ve been cooking this very recipe for twenty years twenty years that s longer than i ve been married had children and american idol has been on the air i remember sitting around my parents living room my senior year in high school flipping through my mom s bon apetit magazine as i was wont to do on the nights i was grounded which was pretty often i found a recipe for pasta primavera which i d never heard of before and spent the rest of the evening whipping it up for my parents it was so delicious they ungrounded me right there on the spot then i went out and got arrested not really as far as you know but the pasta really really was delicious and provided a wonderful basis for the version i make today over the years i ve played with the recipe a lot and have finally reached a pasta primavera nirvana a goal to which every self respecting pasta lover should aspire the key lies more in the method than the ingredients indeed using your own personal blend of favorite veggies is part of the fun of this dish i figured out that it s best to cook the vegetables in separate batches and to cook them only very slightly at first then later when you add them to the creamy flavorful sauce you ll have a little wiggle room to adjust the thickness and seasonings without overcooking them if you cook them all together then create the sauce in the same pan the veggies will invariably overcook and become soggy and lifeless the method i ve figured out ensures a perfectly flavorful sauce and perfectly al dente vegetables which is the secret to perfect pasta primavera let s go for it the cast of characters zucchini yellow squash onion garlic broccoli carrots mushrooms red bell pepper frozen peas buter whipping heavy cream half and half and parmesan oh and sliced green onions if you like but i forgot to add them today either way it s still delish oh and a glass of dry white wine optional start with the broccoli get a big chunk or two then begin cutting it into smaller pieces then cut off the stems but you ll want to leave them in the dish now you should have a good cup to cup and a half of bite sized broccoli pieces now take your onion and cut it in half from top to bottom now cut off the top peel away the outer layer make vertical slices then rotate it    degrees and slice down to dice i like to dice the onion pretty finely now take the garlic bulb and remove three or four cloves with a heavy jar or can smash each clove and peel away the papery layer chop the garlic finely now peel two medium large carrots and slice them on the bias diagonal now take two zucchini and slice them on the bias too i love zucchini there s something about it that makes me want to sculpt now get your mushrooms i usually use white button mushrooms but i thought these baby porcinis looked interesting i love mushrooms i mean love there s something about them that makes me want to play beethoven s ninth on a ukulele slice em up roughly no need to be precise i also like to use yellow squash but you don t have to if they scare the living daylights out of you they used to scare me when i was nine at night i d wake up screaming if they ever entered my dreams the pile of veggies is really beginning to grow we re running out of cutting board space now take the lovely vibrant red pepper slice off the top slice off the bottom and either pull or cut out the core if you re bored you could always throw this on your wrist wear it as a bangle and go paint the town red for awhile oh and that s porcini mushroom under my fingernail not manure now just cut the pepper in half from top to bottom and slice it into strips i don t know about you but i m tired of cutting vegetables let s get down to the cookin now heat   tablespoons butter with   tablespoons olive oil in a medium high skillet now important stuff here i believe the key to perfect pasta primavera is the vegetables not becoming overcooked in years past i d typically throw all the vegetables into the skillet together cook them thoroughly read too long then actually cook the sauce in the pan with the veggies which would only add to their cooking time by the end though the flavor way great the vegetables would be flaccid and lifeless and i d beat myself over the head with a tenderizing mallet so what we re going to do is cook the vegetables every so slightly in batches start by adding the chopped onion and garlic together cook for a minute or two until they start to turn translucent now throw in the broccoli stir it around and add in the carrots stir it around and please please cook it for only a minute tops the key here is not to cook the vegetables thoroughly but just to warm them and get them coated in butter oil after you ve cooked them for a minute transfer mixture to a plate now add in the red pepper strips stir them around for a minute or so then transfer them to the plate now s a good time to cook the pasta i like penne but linguini s great too dump it in slightly salted boiling water and let s get back to the veggies the skillet s looking a little dry and lonely so why dontcha just go ahead and add a tablespoon of butter a tablespoon of butter covers a multitude of sins now add in the zucchini and squash you definitely don t want to overcook this less than a minute is probably fine i m deathly afraid of overcooking my pasta primavera vegetables i ve seriously got to get a life remove the zucchini squash and add the shrooms to the pan i add a little salt to these don t ask me why because i rarely have a good reason for doing things go ahead and cook the mushrooms a minute or two as you don t have to be concerned about keeping them crisp ain t gonna happen just look at your lovely plate of undercooked crispy definitely not overcooked veggies now s the fun part making the creamy sauce into the empty skillet pour     to     cup dry white wine mmmmm there s no greater smell in the world than that stuff hitting the pan now add about     cup low sodium chicken broth if you re averse to wine go ahead and add a whole cup of chicken broth but watch the salt later stir in a tablespoon or so of butter now you need to scrape the bottom of the pan i love this flat whisk isn t it groovy any whisk will do though now stir around scraping the flavorful dark bits off the bottom of the pan this ll really add some character to the sauce cook for a minute or two until liquid starts to thicken now add   cup whipping heavy cream oh live a little you can get on the stairmaster later now add   cup half and half see i could have used all cream but i wanted to be health conscious now take   or   fresh basil leaves we need to chiffonade the basil start by rolling the leaves into a somewhat tight ball then make thin slices hey you just chiffonadedededed basil leaves your life is complete now add a nice helping about     cup grated parmesan and stir it thoroughly now taste the sauce and add salt to taste also add black pepper fresh ground is best but not mandatory for pete s sake really go for it with the pepper it belongs in this sauce now add in the basil and stir it in the basil rrrrrrrrreally makes this dish so don t be bashful now dump in all the veggies mushrooms too and go ahead and dump in about     cup frozen peas right out of the freezer now dump in the al dente not overcooked still has bite pasta and stirrrrrrr together oh geez i m getting hungry now if the sauce seems a little thick or if there doesn t seem to be enough sauce go ahead and add a good splash of chicken broth and oh what the heck how bout a little more half and half oh and a little more parmesan wouldn t hurt a little more salt pepper and we re talking perfection to serve it i like to dump it onto a big platter hello gorgeous wanna dance there should be some sauce collecting around the edges i like to throw some more chiffonade of basil all over the top because i m a middle child here s a close up look at the freaky delicious ridiculous sauce now go forth and make this pasta primavera your sensory receptors will never be the same and if any of you men try it i want to hear from you i need to believe prep time    minutes cook time    minutes difficulty easy servings   ingredients   cup bite sized broccoli pieces up to       cups   whole onion diced finely  cloves to   cloves garlic chopped finely  whole medium to large carrots sliced on the bias diagonally   whole medium zucchini sliced on the bias diagonally   whole medium yellow squash optional   container about   oz white button or baby porcini mushrooms roughly sliced  whole red bell pepper sliced into strips  tablespoons butter  tablespoons olive oil  pound pasta i like penne for the sauce   cups dry white wine up to     cup optional replace with additional broth if not using   cups low sodium chicken broth  cup whipping heavy cream  cup half and half  cups grated parmesan cheese  leaves basil or more to taste plus extra for garnish  cups

       " 'lemon curd is a thick soft and velvety cream that has a wonderful tart yet sweet citrus flavor traditionally it was used as a spread for scones but today it is used as a filling for tarts pies and cakes what i like about lemon curd is that it does not use exotic ingredients just eggs sugar lemon juice lemon zest and unsalted butter it is similar to a lemon filling or custard in that it is cooked on the stove but yet it does not contain a thickener such as cornstarch corn flour we are going to cook the curd in a stainless steel bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water a double boiler this method does take a little longer but it helps prevent the eggs from curdling which gives the curd all those annoying little specks of cooked egg just make sure that the water in the bottom saucepan is simmering which is defined as the point just short of a boil that is when bubbles start to appear oftentimes if you find the lemon curd is not thickening fast enough all you need to do is increase the temperature of the simmering water once the lemon curd has become nice and thick like hollandaise remove it from the heat and strain to remove any lumps that may have formed then stir in the butter and lemon zest and you re done cover immediately with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate you will find that the lemon curd will continue to thicken as it cools it will keep in the refrigerator for about a week if you want to make the lemon curd lighter in texture and flavor you can fold in a little whipped cream once the curd has been thoroughly chilled now lemon curd has to be made with fresh lemons do not use the imitation lemon juice that comes in a bottle when choosing lemons look for ones that are fragrant with brightly colored oily yellow skins the best ones are firm plump and heavy for their size don t buy lemons that have blemishes soft spots or are hard and wrinkled lemons consist of a yellow outer rind skin that can be of varying thickness and graininess and can have either a bumpy or a smooth texture this outer skin is where most of the lemon s wonderful tangy flavor is located before removing the outer rind zest make sure you wash the lemon thoroughly soap and water is best when removing the zest do not remove the white membrane pith that is underneath as it is very bitter tasting once you have removed the outer rind inside the lemon are small vessels called pulp vesicles which contain the pleasantly acidic lemon juice and seeds squeezing the lemon by hand or with a lemon squeezer or reamer releases this clear tart juice lemon curd recipe lemon curd is a thick  soft and creamy  spreadable cream that has a wonderful tart yet sweet flavor  traditionally it was used as a spread for scones but today we also use it to fill our tarts  pies  cakes  and as part of a trifle ',\n",

       " 'there are times when i need to put out a warning sign for a recipe that say bake at your own risk because the smell will be so good that you will eat the whole things well for this cinnamon sugar pull apart bread i am warning you don t come back here and tell me i didn t not only does this smell good but it s just a cool bread it pulls apart very easily and it looks cool do i need to say more just a few yeast notes because i have had comments before where folks can t get their bread to rise with yeast few things to think about with yeast especially if you are using dry yeast make sure your yeast is not old or expired old yeast either will not rise or takes much longer to rise secondly make sure your warm ingredients are lukewarm not cold and not too hot think warm milk to your baby then let it rise in a warm place i usually put it on my stove and have the light on cinnamon sugar pull apart bread adapted from joy the baker yields one  x x  inch loaf prep time   hours bake time    minutes for the dough       cups plus   tbsp all purpose flour    cup granulated sugar      tsp   envelope active dry yeast    tsp salt  oz unsalted butter    cup whole milk    cup water  large eggs at room temperature  tsp pure vanilla extract for the filling   cup granulated sugar  tsp ground cinnamon    tsp fresh ground nutmeg  oz unsalted butter melted until browned in a large mixing bowl whisk together   cups flour sugar yeast and salt set aside whisk together eggs and set aside in a small saucepan melt together milk and butter until butter has just melted remove from the heat and add water and vanilla extract let mixture stand for a minute or two or until the mixture registers     to     degrees f pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula add the eggs and stir the mixture until the eggs are incorporated into the batter the eggs will feel soupy and it ll seem like the dough and the eggs are never going to come together keep stirring add the remaining     cup of flour and stir with the spatula for about   minutes the mixture will be sticky that s just right place the dough is a large greased bowl cover with a clean kitchen towel place in a warm space and allow to rest until doubled in size about   hour note the dough can be risen until doubled in size then refrigerated overnight for use in the morning if you re using this method just let the dough rest on the counter for    minutes before following the roll out directions below while the dough rises whisk together the sugar cinnamon and nutmeg for the filling set aside melt   ounces of butter until browned set aside grease and flour a  x x  inch loaf pan set that aside too deflate the risen dough and knead about   tablespoons of flour into the dough cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rest for   minutes on a lightly floured work surface use a rolling pin to roll the dough out the dough should be    inches tall and about    inches long use a pastry brush to spread melted butter across all of the dough sprinkle with all of the sugar and cinnamon mixture it might seem like a lot of sugar but just go for it slice the dough vertically into six equal sized strips stack the strips on top of one another and slice the stack into six equal slices once again you ll have six stacks of six squares layer the dough squares in the loaf pan like a flip book place a kitchen towel over the loaf pan and allow in a warm place for    to    minutes or until almost doubled in size place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to     degrees f place loaf in the oven and bake for    to    minutes until the top is very golden brown the top may be lightly browned but the center may still be raw a nice dark golden brown will ensure that the center is cooked as well remove from the oven and allow to rest for    to    minutes run a butter knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the bread and invert onto a clean board place a cake stand or cake plate on top of the upside down loaf and carefully invert so it s right side up serve warm with coffee or tea this bread is best served the day it s made but it can also we wrapped and kept at room temperature

it or not but february was heart awareness month i know that february is long gone i might be a little behind but i do have a calendar on my desktop but our heart is with us every day and every second

already too much leads to high blood pressure cut down on any refined sugars and especially high fructose corn syrup use natural sweeteners if you still want to satisfy your sweet cravings opt for natural sweeteners like fruit honey and organic maple syrup because these sweet treats combine sugar fructose with vitamins and fiber that are so important for a healthy heart do not go overboard though everything is good in moderation follow the       rule it is great to eat healthy all the time but it is virtually impossible leave a    room for any unhealthy cravings fast food on a road trip

many natural products as possible some of the examples are eating an orange instead of drinking orange juice fixing your own chicken for sandwiches instead of using deli meats choosing whole wheat bread and pasta instead of white varieties be full of beans one third of a cup of cooked beans daily can lower your chances of having a heart attack by    cut back on breakfast cereals while there are some healthy options most cereals are far from being a healthy start of the day too much sugar no vitamins or fiber high levels of sodium and even trans fats turn this traditional breakfast food into a disaster for your heart before you buy your next box take your time to read the label and choose the most natural and healthy cereal sip some tea the antioxidants in green and black tea improve blood vessel function and increase blood flow drink your tea without sugar eat a few dried apricots or add some honey to give it a sweet note and choose organic loose tea that has not been stripped of all healthy nutrients go bananas bananas are the most heart healthy fruits because they have high levels of potassium dried apricots and prunes are also excellent sources of this mineral have a baked potato spuds are a top source of potassium a mineral that can offset the effects of sodium drink your veggies you can get an extra serving of vegetables by drinking a low sodium vegetable juice it is even better to make your own juice at home and drink it for breakfast do not forget to add some apples and carrots to make this juice drinkable go italian italian cuisine uses tomatoes and tomato sauce abundantly and it is your best bet to lower your risks of heart attack or stroke by    spaghetti with marinara sauce vegetarian lasagna and pizza with half the cheese and double the sauce are excellent ideas for any heart healthy meals eat salmon and sardines for lunch these varieties of fish are great sources of omega   fatty acids that protect you against inflammation and lower triglycerides have a salmon sandwich instead of tuna or mix sardines with spicy mustard and red onions and serve them with bread or crackers spice up your meals onions and garlic might not be your best choice if you are going on a romantic date or an important interview but they can remove excess ldl cholesterol from your body onions and garlic also will give a nice flavor to any dish without

can cook healthy meals in a way that you have never tried them before your taste buds won t even notice the difference share portions or take half of the portion home avoid appetizers and bread with butter ask your waiter for sauces and gravies on the side do not order fried breaded or tempura dishes ask your waiter how your meal is prepared and what ingredients are used satisfy your eyes not

friends a lot had       points higher blood pressure than their more sociable peers detach from stuff we surround ourselves with tons of things that make our life easier that bring certain pleasures into our lives and that look nice or help us kill time when we are bored practice detachment from all this stuff and you will find your heart to be much more open to everything around you have a plan for a stressful situation we cannot avoid all stressful situations in our life but we can prepare for them make it a rule to think of one positive thing in your life whenever stressful thoughts start creeping into your head or carry a list of things that you are grateful for another idea is to have a few pictures of the happiest moments of your life or people who always bring happiness in your life with you take a tech break being plugged in all the time puts you on the edge and increases the production of stress hormones that cause your blood pressure to rise turn off your cell phone in the evening do not check your email and log off any im system have this time to yourself not somebody else meditate meditation calms your mind and your heart at the same time practice it daily or at

good is good enough enjoy your time in silence and solitude make it a habit to spend some time alone weekly to let your mind float away your stress dissolve in the air and your heart open to the miracles of the world slow down in life fast paced life leads to depression and stress it undermines your ability to enjoy time with your family or doing things you love all these factors are important for a healthy and open heart have a me break giving working helping taking care of others are all honorable missions but you need some time for yourself do not consider it pampering or selfishness this is your chance to get reacquainted with yourself and to have some rest from the world around you no matter how wonderful it might be let yourself relax being in the always ready condition is very stressful let somebody else take care of the kids order a take out not more than twice a month remember take a day off at work and let yourself completely relax your heart will enjoy

people and you will notice how your own levels of optimism will shift be happy according to a recent study in nova scotia canada happiness and general positivity protects heart from any degenerative disease laugh just    minutes of laughter daily can boost your blood flow by    percent and prevent your arteries from hardening call a funny friend or watch a comedy every day speak up bottling up

levels spend       minutes a day doing something that you like do not abandon it if your schedule gets too busy practice random acts of kindness while you are taking care of your physical heart do not forget that you are more complex than a machine kind heart is as important as low cholesterol for your health be kind for no apparent reason and find deepest joy in this kindness savor joyful events if something amazing happens in your life remember this event and go over it when you are feeling down practice forgiveness holding a grudge will harden your heart and close it to the entire world forgive people and move on with your life visualize your best self if you are not satisfied with yourself then think of what would make you completely happy with yourself visualize this picture every day and start taking small steps to reach this goal be generous generosity boosts happiness on an everyday basis start small by giving smiles to everybody around you and give as much as your heart wants to be positive both optimists and pessimists have bad days but optimists get over those days quickly while pessimists savor their sufferings and complain about their lives constantly no matter what the day brings you choose to be positive and concentrate on good things around you express your heart s desires our creativity is born in our heart and if we suppress any spark of it then we also block our hearts from happiness express whatever is born in your heart to keep your heart young and open for life show some self love take care of your needs as much as you take care of others even though being generous is a key to keeping your heart young you must still learn to be generous to yourself do not be a martyr because the times when it was appreciated are long gone say a prayer open your heart to god and he will take care of you say a prayer from your heart and you will feel that any of your burdens have been lifted and your heart will be touched by him practice gratitude be grateful for what you have and for what will come be grateful even for what you do not have because chances are that you are better off without it try something new keep your heart open to new experiences by trying something new as often as possible this practice will keep your heart agile and young for many years and when you are       or     you will not consider yourself an old wreck you will be a person who has lived and is still living his her life with a young heart follow your passion following your passion will help you live a more fulfilling life it will help you fight stress in life and be happy in general if you can earn living by following your passion then it is great go for it but if not just devote some time in your busy schedule to do what you are passionate about whether it is writing cooking or just playing with your kids help somebody helping people around you whether these are people you know or complete strangers is the best way to keep your heart open kind and young according to the research peggy thoits professor of sociology at vanderbilt university volunteering increased happiness life satisfaction self esteem sense of control over life physical health and decreased depression it is healthy to be good kiss hug touch little things like holding hands hugging kissing lovingly and cuddling are the signs of a strong couple strong couples have better emotional and intellectual connections they have better and more frequent sex and they have less amounts of stress which leads to heart disease this is a no brainer if you want to take care of your heart take care of your relationship and treasure the connection physical and mental that you have by the way non sexual hugs and touches with friends or family members have proved to increase happiness and even lower blood pressure hold a hug for at least   seconds be patient patience brings many benefits but the most heart healthy one is less stress in your life you do not have to get mad when you sit in a traffic jam or waste your time standing in a line distract yourself with pleasant thoughts about your family plan your supper ahead of time or think about ideas for a new business find your virtues a strong heart is a virtuous heart because this heart knows how to do the right thing for the right reason   do not let your heart go numb when you feel that you avoid new experiences new emotions new adventures because you are scared of pain and disappointment know that you are intentionally blocking your heart you are suffocating it by not letting it live and breathe fully do not be scared open up and embrace life instead of hiding from it share experience with your loved ones our society has become too materialistic our expression of love or apology usually has a price tag on it money can buy you a comfortable life but it can t buy you happiness spend quality time with the people you care about and enjoy every moment together see miracles around you our life is full of miracles that we often do not notice train yourself to see those miracles around you a birth of a child or wonderful butterfly in your yard are both miracles and you will notice that your life will get more positive find the meaning of your life meaningless life leads to an empty heart and an empty heart has no way of staying healthy and young live a meaningful life that fills your heart be childlike not childish children are honest joyful full of energy open to the world full of love for the entire world not scared of anything and absolutely adorable play with them spend as much time with them as possible and learn from them this is the best way to maintain your youthfulness inside and out enjoy your life focus on enjoying every moment of your life and making every moment count what is the point of living a life even with a healthy heart if this life is empty and boring do things try things be brave lose your fears love be passionate and stay positive make decisions that you will be proud of and avoid mistakes that you will regret make it all count be in love love opens our hearts and makes us bloom all year round cherish the love that you have and try

       " 'i don t purport this tutorial as being the ideal way to download youtube videos to your computer a simple google search will lead you to an assortment of options that requires less technical expertise however if you re like me and are relatively new to the command line think your os without the gui and a mouse this might be an interesting way to accomplish something relatively useful download youtube videos to your computer and also learn how to directly communicate with your computer in this tutorial i ll be using a command line program called youtube dl sorry window users this walkthrough is tailored for mac linux users however there is a nice write up here which you can follow as well working with terminal the basics i m no command line genius maybe just a hair above a beginner i know how to navigate my way through the system directory output files folders copy delete stuff and open applications thankfully that should be enough for completing this guide first download and save the youtube dl program to your computer here you should right click the link and select save link as and save the file with the python extension py next open up terminal on your mac type in cd usr local note this is a hidden directory on your computer system where some of the core programs are being handled thus i urge extra caution when working here i also like to use the ls command which outputs a list of all the files and directories i can navigate to next based on my current location go ahead and try it now next type into terminal open bin click to enlarge a new finder window should appear containing a bunch of cryptic looking files the reason why we have to navigate to this folder via terminal is because by default it is a hidden system folder meaning it can t be reached via finder alone there is a terminal command to display all hidden files by default but it is generally advised not to do so press authenticate and enter your login credentials paste your youtube dl py file now in the bin folder you are in a pop up will appear telling you that you don t have permission to do so select authenticate and enter your login password verify that the file was correctly saved to the directory currently in terminal we are sitting inside the usr local directory next type in cd bin this moves you into the bin folder where you had saved the youtube dl py file to in the previous step a short intro to file permissions file permissions determine which users can perform a certain action on specific files and directories there are read r write w and execute x permissions and are assigned to three types of users a user u b group g and c other o read the following articles for a more further details the reason why i mention file permissions is because you will need to edit the file permissions for the youtube dl py file currently residing in your bin folder at the moment the file only has read and write access to the user which is you you can view the permissions using the ls command mentioned earlier by including the l option which displays extra details so typing in the following ls l while in the bin directory should display something like this rwxrwxr x   tonyhue staff       jan         twdiff rwxrwxr x   tonyhue staff       jan         twfind rw r xr x   tonyhue staff        oct          youtube dl py there should be other files but i only included the last three which includes the youtube dl py file you can also check the permissions for a specific file directory by using the g option ls lg youtube dl py in order for the program to run you need to give yourself execution permission currently youtube dl py has read and write access to add execution permission we will use the chmod command by typing in chmod u x youtube dl py verify that the correct permissions for the file contain read write and execution permission by typing in ls lg youtube dl py almost there congrats you ve hopefully made it this far unscathed after modifying the permissions for the youtube dl py file you can now start downloading youtube videos to your computer from the command line just type in youtube dl py youtube video link don t include the bracket parenthesis things should be working properly if terminal outputs something that looks like this youtube w   h zuqzw downloading video webpage youtube w   h zuqzw downloading video info webpage youtube w   h zuqzw extracting video information download destination w   h zuqzw mp  download       of     m at     m s eta       don t fret if you start getting error messages try restarting terminal and attempting again verify that youtube dl py has rwx permissions also check to see if you remembered to include the py extension if all has gone according to plan you should be able to find your newly downloaded video in your users folder yeah i know terrible place to put it amiright what else pat yourself on the back once more you ve successfully downloaded a youtube video to your computer youtube dl has a number of available options to customize the video you download such as changing the video filename to the video s title instead of its id also the program can also download videos from other sources besides youtube including vimeo daily motion and metacafe the sky is the limit majoring in technology downloading videos off youtube is such a common ritual on the internet  but how about doing it via the command line  command line  terminal  youtube videos  download youtube videos i don t purport this tutorial as being the ideal way to download youtube videos to your

       " 'it has long been my personal belief that the egg salad sandwich is a sandwich too ugly to look at let alone eat i m talking about those structure less mayo bombs served on soggy white bread an egg salad sandwich fitting this description shows up at my house roughly once a week wrapped in tight fitting plastic pretty much whenever wayne hits up the neighborhood sandwich shop i always look at him incredulously and ask really you really want to eat that i just don t get it generally speaking he doesn t even like eggs very much whoever cast the egg salad sandwich spell on him did a fine job it wasn t until last week when we went to the vivienne westwood exhibit at the de young museum that i was forced to rethink my position at the caf  my friend quyen submitted her sandwich order one egg salad please i looked at her and shook my head you too this in turn opened up a lengthy lunchtime conversation on the merit of egg salad egg salad sandwich lovers   haters   my case wasn t helped by what was about to come out of the caf  kitchen when her sandwich appeared before us the clouds parted angels sang and a golden beam of sunlight was cast onto her plate it was an egg salad sandwich of a totally different breed you could see vibrant yellow yolks flecks of herbs and capers mayo little if any and the best part not a soggy piece of bread in sight and this is how inspiration strikes i saw quyen s tasty looking egg salad sandwich and it showed me that a sandwich made of hard boiled eggs can be appetizing to both the eye and the taste buds i thought about it for a few days and came up with a game plan for my own that went something like this for the bread whole grain bread toasted and sliced on the thin side toasting will help deter the sog factor some crunchy add ins were going to be critical to counter the mush factor of the eggs my choice chopped celery eggs pair beautifully with herbs at the market i was on the lookout for fresh dill but came across chives instead perfect i knew i was after a drier egg salad mixture and would use a minimal amount of mayo just enough to bind the egg mixture together achieving bright yellow yolks would be of the utmost importance a friend of my sister s recommended chopped bacon as an addition i countered with fried shallots but didn t end up using them at the last minute the flavor was overpowering the eggs and chives if you wanted to go that route a remix of this sandwich where you broil some thinly sliced gruyere cheese onto your toast top with the egg salad mixture sprinkle with the fried shallots and serve open faced would likely be delicious it also dawned on me that this is prime egg salad sandwich season put all those leftover hard boiled eggs from easter to good use i should note that we always had leftover hardboiled eggs that we didn t use in the hunt before i sign off i d like to thank everyone for the overwhelmingly enthusiastic response to the unwilling cook s letter earlier this week     fantastic thoughtful responses and they are still coming in it makes me very proud to have such an amazing community of readers and i promise to keep you posted on his progress i ve realized that    of the challenge here is properly boiling the egg you need to boil it so the center sets yet stays moist you also need to avoid the green grey ring thing that surrounds the yolk in many hard boiled eggs i use the same technique here that i learned camping with a hardcore egg enthusiast it has worked for me flawlessly ever since the key is to avoid over cooking and to dunk the eggs in a bowl of icy water to stop the cooking after you remove them from the hot water i always use good quality eggs but something to keep in mind the fresher they are the harder they are to peel after boiling   large eggs    tablespoons mayonnaise or greek yogurt salt and peppera tiny squeeze of lemon juice  stalks celery washed and chopped    bunch chives chopped  small handfuls of lettuce  slices of whole grain bread toasted place the eggs in a pot and cover with cold water by a     inch or so bring to a gentle boil now turn off the heat cover and let sit for exactly seven minutes have a big bowl of ice water ready and when the eggs are done cooking place them in the ice bath for three minutes or so long enough to stop the cooking crack and peel each egg place in a medium mixing bowl add the mayonnaise a couple generous pinches of salt and pepper now mash with a fork don t overdo it you want the egg mixture to have some texture if you need to add a bit more mayo to moisten up the mixture a bit go for it a bit at a time stir in the celery and chives taste and adjust the seasoning adding more salt and pepper if needed to assemble each egg salad sandwich place a bit of lettuce on a piece of toast top with the egg salad mixture and finish by creating a sandwich with a second piece of toast make   sandwiches print recipe the egg salad sandwich recipe i turn to multiple times a week

       " 'i really need to preface this tutorial with i am sorry i am sure there are easier ways to do a vertical layer cake but i was being a brat for my birthday i wanted real cake and not sponge cake i wanted two different flavors that might be a pregnancy thing i wanted massive amounts of frosting that might be a pregnancy thing too hence i bucked every traditional mold i had seen for a vertical layer cake and made my own sorry the second time making the cake i was surprised by how quickly everything went its amazing how much smoother life is with a plan huh i gotta remember that anywho i made two cakes one red velvet and one white cake i made them in  in pans and used these methods for creating a level cake here is an important step immediately out of the oven like say within five minutes at most i removed the cakes from their pans and cut of the top crusty layer of cake of both  in cakes i then placed the cut parts together it should look like a two layer cake here except without frosting then put it in the freezer for no less then five hours the reason i do this is   i want the height of a two layer cake four or five inches   i do not want a frosting seam   this helps to meld the layers together so they appear one complete layer if you have a  in deep cake pan and can successfully bake a  in cake then just do that lots easier btw now once the cakes have firmed up nicely after a good five hours but give it six if you can you can remove them from the freezer we will begin to cut out our layers i simply used a cardboard cake round as my guide i traced out three evenly ha i am so not a perfectionist so bear with me spaced concentric circles i am now going to cut off the outside circle place the template back on the cake now i need to carve around that circle its important to try and get your knife at a    degree angle you want a very straight up and down cut follow the template as close as you can a sharp knife here is a great idea you are going to do this with both cakes now i cut off another circle and started the process again do this to both cakes then cut off another circle so you are left with the center portion fyi if you want to do another circle therefore making your center smaller you certainly can you are now left with two cakes that have concentric circles cut in each the next step might go against everything you know about cake but just do it anyway wow that was bossy take a nice big sharp knife and cut from the outside of the center circle through the cake you are going to gently separate the layers into individual sections this is why it is so important to have a very chilled if not frozen cake choose which center you want to start with i choose the white cake take the next larger layer of the other cake and place it around the center keep doing this alternating the layers until you have a complete cake assembled again and there you go easy right now were you worried about the layers not staying together i fixed that with three easy steps   pour a simple syrup over the re assembled cakes not too much   place a wax paper belt around the cake and bind it together with a cord or towel scrap   place it back in the freezer for a bit a couple hours before you are ready to decorate place the cakes in the fridge so they can thaw without sweating i wouldnt recommend decorating a frozen cake now please forgive me but i didn t decorate the outside with the roses i just did a smooth layer of frosting then wrote out a romantic quote i found from shakespeare its nothing fancy but it was easy you weren t here for the outside right when i saw you i fell in love and you smiled because you knew and there are the vertical layers if you make this cake please let me know i would love to see and of course love to know if you came up with an easier way valentines day  cake  tutorial  vertical layer cake  layer cake i really need to preface this tutorial with    i am sorry  i am sure there are easier ways to do a vertical layer cake  but i was being a brat for my birthday  i wanted real cake  and not sponge cake  i wanted two different flavors   that might be a pregnancy thing  i wanted massive amounts of frosting   that might be a pregnancy thing too  hence  i bucked every traditional mold i had seen for a vertical layer cake and made my own  sorry  the second time making the cake i was surprised by how quickly everything went  its amazing   ',\n",

piles of laundry and food staring us in the face day in and day out we become lost to it there are times i try to fight it and times i just let it go change can be scary i get that but change can also bring us new found passions and joy now you know why it took me so long to get a new couch between my terrible decision making and my husband s lack of enthusiasm for change things can happen s l o w l y around our house in the kitchen i have to play on things i know he likes and see if i can come up with something new that will still grant him that feeling of familiarity potatoes those are always

as quick as i can in the evening frozen vegetable are a huge timesaver and may be even more healthful than some of the fresh produce sold in supermarkets because they are usually processed at their peak ripeness when they are most nutrient packed i ve recently partnered with conagra foods to talk about the importance of cooking with frozen foods and how they can help save you time in the kitchen they had sent me a box full of frozen goodness that happened to include a bag of alexia classic oven crinkles french fries made from ingredients that i recognize these fries are certified organic and contain   grams of fiber per serving perfect for our steak sandwich dinner i know steve loves buffalo hot wings so i was pretty sure he d like buffalo cheese fries and starting with frozen french

a few changes and here s what i came up with using ingredients on hand little bites big taste it was time for recipe club again and i wanted to try something new some friends and were talking about poundcake on twitter which lead to a search for various poundcake recipes i took some inspiration from a honey vanilla sour cream poundcake and a lightened up version of sour cream poundcake with rum glaze to come up with my recipe i actually made this recipe twice the full version and a half version because my first cake got stuck in the bundt pan i must say the halved version of the cake was tastier but the first cake made for great strawberry shortcake two recipes diverged into a sunny kitchen this is the second part of my birthday cake post i was hungry for a black forest cake but more specifically chocolate and cherries i thought about making this for valentine s day but plans lasik surgery got in the way so i decided to make this and share with family for our youngest daughter s first birthday the thing i love about black forest cake is the chocolate and the cherries so i wanted to feature those two things in my cake pie filling meet cake life s been a little crazy and i haven t been in the kitchen as much as usual so trying to get back on track this is the first installment of a two part post our youngest just celebrated her first birthday and in keeping with tradition i made her a mini bear cake since we would be celebrating with family i made a black forest cake part   and a last minute decision to add the bear to the top of it baby s first cake has to

levels first and most importantly the end result is absolutely superior to the commercial brands in both taste and texture i bake my chips with just the thinnest coating of oil so the resulting chip bakes up satisfyingly crisp with a very slight chew and not at all greasy the corn comes through strong and clear not at all like the salt lick flavor of most commercial chips here s a step by step guide to making these lighter healthier chips at home i that feel a homemade corn chip is a thing apart from what you find in those enormous bags of name brand commercial chips besides the taste and texture homemade versions are far less oily and salty making them a much healthier choice this is also a good recipe for those of you who aren t interested in taking on the challenges of deep frying all total this recipe takes about       minutes to assemble and bake i find that my approach to eating these chips is different too instead of mindlessly shoveling them into my mouth with my homemade chips i m more apt to eat them slowly and their slight chewiness means i pay more attention while i am eating them and because i m preparing them from scratch they re less of an impulse snack and more of a special treat with these chips it s all about the quality of the tortillas i m fortunate to live in an area with a large latin american population so my chances of scoring amazing grandma made authentic tortillas are very high when i do i always buy extra storing them in the freezer in packs of six that way i can remove what i need and leave them to quickly thaw on my counter trader joe s

oven and oil trays preheat oven to     f pour a few tablespoons of oil into a bowl and brush a thin coating onto your baking trays set aside   oil and stack the tortillas place one tortilla on the cutting board and brush the top with a light layer of oil you don t need a lot of oil but do pay attention to the outer edges of the tortilla an area that s easy to miss place another tortilla on top of the oiled one and brush the top with oil continue in this manner until all your tortillas are oiled and stacked in one pile   cut into wedges using a large sharp knife cut your tortilla stack in half using one firm chop if possible cut one of the halves in half and cut each of those halves in half again forming wedges repeat with other side this will give you eight stacks of tortilla wedges   arrange on trays and salt arrange the tortilla wedges in a single layer on the oiled trays place the wedges with the un oiled sides facing down so that they have contact with the oil on the try a little overlapping is fine but don t overlap too much or they won t crisp sprinkle a pinch or two of flaked sea salt over the tops being sure that all of the wedges get a touch of salt   bake for   to    minutes place trays in the oven and bake for      minutes check your chips at   minutes and rotate your pans be aware that very thin tortillas are vulnerable to your oven s hot spots and can start to char the chips are done when the edges are crisp and dry and slightly lifted from the tray they should be a few shades darker though not completely browned chips made from handmade tortillas will often have a few brown spots on them so don t worry if you see a few the chips will still be slightly flexible in the middle but will crisp further as they cool   remove and cool remove trays from the oven and let cool slightly as they cool the chips will continue to crisp all the way through test one and if it isn t as crisp as you would like return the trays to the oven for another   or   minutes once the chips are fairly cool remove them from the tray and serve if you re not eating them right away store in an airtight plastic bag or container homemade chips are especially susceptible to

       " 'making your own cheese at home much like other dairy products like yogurt is one of those things that while requiring some demystification and a few special ingredients can be done a lot more easily than you think in the case of mozzarella cheese one of my favorites can be done in less than an hour for the cost of little more than a gallon of milk it s a fun food science experiment one minute you have a pot of milk the next the beginnings of cheese and you get to eat the delicious results let s get started supplies ingredients   gallon or larger i used my   quart stock pot stainless steel or other non reactive e g non aluminum non cast iron pot with lid dairy thermometer colander slotted spoon long knife rubber gloves optional but recommended cheese cloth optional but also recommended   gallon milk not ultra pasteurized if using raw milk and you aren t absolutely positively sure it is free of pathogens heat the milk to     degrees farenheit and keep it there for    minutes to pasteurize it if using store bought milk be sure you go with regular pasteurized milk and not ultra pasteurized it ll say on the label as the latter has been heated to a very high temperature that destroys all the organisms you need to make cheese       cup cool chlorine free water if you don t have a water filtration system that removes chlorine for you you can get it at the grocery store       teaspoon citric acid     teaspoon or     tablet rennet   teaspoon cheese salt or salt substitute optional but again recommended the last three ingredients can be had from anywhere that sells cheese making supplies i got mine in a kit from cheesemaking com but the ingredients aren t that hard to come by photo credit collin dunn turning milk to cheese step   dissolve the rennet in     cup of the cool chlorine free water stir it up and set it aside step   mix citric acid into the remaining   cup of water and stir until dissolved step   pour the milk into your pot stir it continuously while adding the citric acid solution step   continue stirring the milk over medium heat until it reaches    degrees f step   remove the pot from the heat and slowly stir in the rennet solution stirring up and down for about    seconds step   cover the pot and leave it undisturbed for   minutes photo credit collin dunn curds whey step   take off the lid and voila you should have the beginnings of cheese the curd solid will have separated from the whey liquid and the curd should look like custard with a clear separation if the curd is still too soft or milky give it a few more minutes to set if you have something that more closely resembles ricotta cheese you may have stumbled into some ultra pasteurized milk by mistake time to start over sorry photo credit jocelyn tutak cutting the cheese step   cut the curd with the knife be sure that it s long enough to reach the bottom of the pot you want to create little cubes of curd so cut parallel lines about an inch apart at a    degree angle since the goal is creating curd cubes you ll want to make four sets of cuts after the first set of slices rotate the pot    degrees and repeat until your one solid curd has been sliced and diced into a bunch of floating cubes click the photo at left to see what it looks like when you re done photo credit jocelyn tutak heating the curds step   put your pot of curds and whey back on the stove and heat to     degrees f slowly stirring the curds once you achieve     degrees take the pot off the stove while continuing to stir for another   to   minutes more time will equal a firmer cheese photo credit jocelyn tutak separating curds whey step    ladel the curds into the colander which i lined with some cheesecloth folding gently to help drain off the whey repeat a couple of times until the curd begins to become more dense and less moist keep as much of the whey in the pot as you can you ll need it step    once your curds are more or less one solid mass heat the leftover whey or a different pot of water if you got ahead of yourself and discarded your whey to     degrees f put your curds back in the pot for      minutes and don your rubber gloves photo credit jocelyn tutak streching the curds step    remove the curds from the hot whey and stretch if they don t stretch like taffy and fall apart put them back in their bath they have to be about     degrees f to stretch sprinkle the salt on as you stretch you might get a half dozen or so good pulls on it and continue stretching until it s cool the more you work it the firmer it will be so less stretching will equal a softer cheese i found that stretching roughly half of the curd at a time was a good workable amount photo credit jocelyn tutak great balls of cheese step    form your stretched cheese into pleasing shapes i chose balls the little one was the test to see if it was hot enough to stretch if you go with a round shape you can pull the edges up underneath to hide any seams and they ll sort of melt into themselves other options braids string cheese rolled logs the options are only bound by your imagination if you aren t ready to eat your new cheese right away give it a bath in ice water to cool it and store it in the refrigerator for two weeks mine didn t make it that long i sliced it up and made a delicious caprese salad happy cheese making more on making your owncaprese salad

       " 'published on wednesday april   th      stress is a normal human reaction to life s pressures and challenges we spend most of our lives trying to figure out the best ways to avoid stress and keep it under control with exercise sleep a balanced diet and deep breathing exercises but when those traditional stress relievers no longer work people will find alternative and often unhealthy methods to cope with their stress here are the    weirdest ways that people manage stress gambling gambling may seem like a weird way to handle stress but many people find comfort in playing against the odds those who have an insatiable urge to gamble despite potentially negative consequences are often classified as gambling addicts gambling provides an adrenaline rush and sense of euphoria when you win therefore someone who is depressed or burdened by a lot of stress might find solace in gambling self injury cutting some people relieve stress by deliberately hurting themselves this self induced pain is often done by cutting or burning the skin and engaging in dangerous activities people who injure themselves aren t trying to commit suicide but it could be fatal if the injuries are serious enough self injury is often accompanied by several mental illnesses such as depression bipolar disorder and eating disorders no matter the circumstance deliberately harming oneself is an unhealthy way to cope with stress emotional pain and anger hoarding hoarding is a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder ocd in which individuals collect an excessive amount of items that are generally useless or of little value hoarding can also involve collecting animals for many individuals hoarding things is a way to relieve stress and overcome other issues hoarders feel safe and secure when they have their belongings nearby yet it becomes an additional source of stress when it starts to interfere with their safety health and social life hair pulling hair pulling also known as trichotillomania is a disorder that causes people to excessively pull out their hair this irresistible urge to pluck out hair from the scalp eyebrows eyelashes and other parts of the body can be a form of stress relief for certain individuals although the cause of trichotillomania is not clear it s often associated with genetic and environmental factors or chemical imbalances this disorder is not a normal way of managing stress and should not be taken lightly vomiting some people feel a sense of relief to vomit when they re stressed whether the stress has been brought on by nerves an eating disorder or another form of pressure forcing yourself to vomit is not a healthy way of coping with stress those who engage in self induced vomiting may feel temporary relief but this disordered behavior may lead to more sever eating disorders malnutrition extreme weight loss and other serious health problems tattoos getting tattoos is another odd way that people manage stress whether it s the touch of the needle immense pain or increase of endorphins to the brain the experience of getting tattoos can be very soothing to stressed individuals tattooing may also be a less obvious form of self mutilation which can be a cause for concern overworking it s not uncommon for stressed individuals to try to manage their stress by increasing their workload and working overtime many people think they can manage their stress and that things will get easier if they just work longer and harder than normal however overworked people may end up making more mistakes and increasing their stress levels because they haven t allowed themselves to relax and get an adequate amount of rest needed to be efficient throughout the day not dealing with it at all many people manage their stress by not dealing with it at all these people turn a blind eye when they are faced with something stressful and put their problems on the back burner hoping their issues will disappear or resolve themselves others may shut down completely and go into a catatonic state ignoring stress will only make it worse and could lead to further problems spending compulsive shopping and spending is another weird way people manage their stress treating yourself to a nice bracelet or new pair of shoes may seem innocent enough but this compulsive desire to regularly spend money that you probably don t have can become a very serious problem compulsive shoppers face several negative consequences such as extreme debt strained relationships ruined credit history anxiety and additional stress physically fighting today more and more people cope with their stress by physically fighting exercising is simply not enough for these adrenaline junkies who need to let out their aggression on someone else or feel the pain of being hit these people may be hotheads who are always picking fights or an unsuspecting coworker who s a member of an underground fight club no matter their preference fighting is not a normal or healthy way of managing your stress not only are you inflicting injury on someone else but you too could get severely hurt when traditional stress relievers no longer work  people will find

camp he built along the banks of stevenson creek jim damaske times clearwater this is what todd yoder knew about homeless people they are mentally ill dope fiends drunks then in february yoder found himself without work and he has since learned much more it takes about    clusters of oysters from clearwater s stevenson creek to make a meal palm tree fibers make decent kindling but don t leave any hot coals libraries provide sanctuary for desperate men seagulls read minds and a once in a lifetime recession can rip away more than a man s paycheck and his home i no longer knew what purpose i served being alive yoder said other than that it was a habit yoder    hails from rural arkansas and calls himself a redneck and a country boy contrary to type he is well spoken and has a taste for philosophy ludwig wittgenstein s philosophical investigations is a recent read a tough one yoder admits yoder signed with the army as a plumber and pipe fitter after high school when the army saw his intelligence test scores it trained him to be an air traffic controller he served in panama and germany where his    year old son lives with an ex wife during desert storm he spent three months in iraq driving across the sands to deploy radio beacons for aircraft while doing demolition training in germany a premature explosion tore loose his left ear drum he now has    percent hearing loss in that ear his right ear is better but also damaged yoder can hold one on one conversations but any background noise creates for him an incoherent jumble of sound when he left the military in      yoder focused on the skilled trades outside of an office setting his hearing wasn t as much of a problem plus he could work independently which fit his sense of being a loner he built boats did plumbing and spent several years installing telecommunications equipment until the dot com bust he then turned to home building and remodeling when arkansas housing boom collapsed he hopped a bus to florida friends had said there was work he arrived in november and got a     a month apartment on madeira beach yoder did three condo remodeling jobs in dunedin before work dried up not wanting to go into debt he left his apartment and rented a room at the flamingo hotel in clearwater for a week while frantically searching for a job none materialized nor he said did the payment from his last remodeling gig it was mid february and cold when yoder found himself without a roof i felt ashamed he said it makes you feel shameful that you weren t able to keep your s together yoder s original thoughts about homeless people have an element of truth some are mentally ill and substance abusers but an economy that has people talking about the great depression has produced more and more todd yoders people on the margin who find themselves out on the streets when work gets difficult to find it s just a very sad time in our country said cliff smith assistant director of pinellas county s health and human services department until this winter yoder knew nothing about homeless shelters or soup kitchens which he associated with black and white photos from the     s he sought out a secluded bank on stevenson creek behind the clearwater shuffleboard club where he used the remains of an old tree house to build a shelter the first night he slept on a bed of palm fronds he d come to use their thick bases as a primary fuel source for cooking knowing that vagrants and strangers are seen as threats he avoided houses while going to and from his camp skirting along the creek bank to get to edgewater drive it was the first time in my life that i didn t have any options he said so i started operating in survival mode under the palm trees mangroves and oaks he worked the creek bank digging in the muck at low tide for oysters and clams i guess i wasn t your normal homeless guy because i was eating oysters on the half shell and steamed clams from a screen door he fashioned a net he used to trap fish that he d lure into the shallows with oysters one afternoon seagulls visited the bank a hot meal yoder thought the birds appeared to sense the hunter in him and flew off the minute it crossed my mind hey roasted bird it was like they were psychic he now viewed homelessness from a different perspective which he put into a poem the man who was kinghuddled in the coldwatching the cars go bynot bothering a glance his waya funny fatefor the man who would be kinghunger gnawsat his bellyat his mindhis soul though prone to dark spells yoder said he s never been treated for depression by the creek he became consumed by thoughts of suicide the choice was between hanging himself from a tree or jumping from the sunshine skyway i was just very despondent he said i felt utterly defeated he battled on going on foot from business to business looking for work to keep presentable and fight the growing stench of his body yoder took sink baths at nearby edgewater park s public restroom the clearwater public library saved him there he found a clean bathroom shelter and internet service that allowed him to communicate with potential employers his son and his parents he told his family he was doing fine that s just basic pride and shame he said you don t want to admit to the people you care about the most that you ve completely screwed the pooch from the clearwater library and the one in dunedin he would get books to distract him and give him an edge today he almost chuckles as he describes reading a book on how to interview for a job while picking leaves and twigs from his beard he also found other homeless people who told him about programs that could help yoder discovered clearwater s homeless emergency project on the library s internet on march    after a month on the creek bank the project s shelter took him in the department of veterans affairs is paying for yoder s bed at the homeless emergency project through june    then he ll need to find other housing social workers at the project are helping him develop an immediate survival plan yoder himself is setting longer term goals he hopes to become eligible for va disability compensation due to his hearing which worsens with time yoder can t use his back to make a living forever compensation from the va could allow him to enroll at st petersburg college to study sign language interpretation he sees it as a job he can do as he gets older and as a way to help himself as his hearing goes in his journey through the world of the homeless yoder has been amazed by how many people he s met who are just like him

       " 'naturalnews in its never ending attempt to fabricate mental disorders out of every human activity the psychiatric industry is now pushing the most ridiculous disease they ve invented yet healthy eating disorder this is no joke if you focus on eating healthy foods you re mentally diseased and probably need some sort of chemical treatment involving powerful psychotropic drugs the guardian newspaper reports fixation with healthy eating can be sign of serious psychological disorder and goes on to claim this disease is called orthorexia nervosa which is basically just latin for nervous about correct eating but they can t just called it nervous healthy eating disorder because that doesn t sound like they know what they re talking about so they translate it into latin where it sounds smart even though it isn t that s where most disease names come from doctors just describe the symptoms they see with a name like osteoporosis which means bones with holes in them getting back to this fabricated orthorexia disease the guardian goes on to report orthorexics commonly have rigid rules around eating refusing to touch sugar salt caffeine alcohol wheat gluten yeast soya corn and dairy foods is just the start of their diet restrictions any foods that have come into contact with pesticides herbicides or contain artificial additives are also out wait a second so attempting to avoid chemicals dairy soy and sugar now makes you a mental health patient yep according to these experts if you actually take special care to avoid pesticides herbicides and genetically modified ingredients like soy and sugar there s something wrong with you but did you notice that eating junk food is assumed to be normal if you eat processed junk foods laced with synthetic chemicals that s okay with them the mental patients are the ones who choose organic natural foods apparently i told you this was coming years ago i warned naturalnews readers that an attempt might soon be under way to outlaw broccoli because of its anti cancer phytonutrients this mental health assault on health conscious consumers is part of that agenda it s an effort to marginalize healthy eaters by declaring them to be mentally unstable and therefore justify carting them off to mental institutions where they will be injected with psychiatric drugs and fed institutional food that s all processed dead and full of toxic chemicals the guardian even goes to the ridiculous extreme of saying the obsession about which foods are good and which are bad means orthorexics can end up malnourished follow the non logic on this if you can eating good foods will cause malnutrition eating bad foods i suppose is assumed to provide all the nutrients you need that s about as crazy a statement on nutrition as i ve ever read no wonder people are so diseased today the mainstream media is telling them that eating health food is a mental disorder that will cause malnutrition it s just like i reported years ago you re not supposed to question your food folks sit down shut up dig in and chow down stop thinking about what you re eating and just do what you re told by the mainstream media and its processed food advertisers questioning the health properties of your junk food is a mental disorder didn t you know and if you obsess over foods by doing such things as reading the ingredients labels for example then you re weird maybe even sick that s the message they re broadcasting now junk food eaters are normal and sane and nourished but health food eaters are diseased abnormal and malnourished but why you ask would they attack healthy eaters people like dr gabriel cousens can tell you why because increased mental and spiritual awareness is only possible while on a diet of living natural foods eating junk foods keeps you dumbed down and easy to control you see it literally messes with your mind numbing your senses with msg aspartame and yeast extract people who subsist on junk foods are docile and quickly lose the ability to think for themselves they go along with whatever they re told by the tv or those in apparent positions of authority never questioning their actions or what s really happening in the world around them in contrast to that people who eat health enhancing natural foods with all the medicinal nutrients still intact begin to awaken their minds and spirits over time they begin to question the reality around them and they pursue more enlightened explorations of topics like community nature ethics philosophy and the big picture of things that are happening in the world they become aware and can start to see the very fabric of the matrix so to speak this of course is a huge danger to those who run our consumption based society because consumption depends on ignorance combined with suggestibility for people to keep blindly buying foods medicines health insurance and consumer goods they need to have their higher brain functions switched off processed junk foods laced with toxic chemicals just happens to achieve that rather nicely why do you think dead processed foods remain the default meals in public schools hospitals and prisons it s because dead foods turn off higher levels of awareness and keep people focused on whatever distractions you can feed their brains television violence fear sports sex and so on but living as a zombie is in one way quite normal in society today because so many people are doing it but that doesn t make it normal in my book the real normal is an empowered healthy awakened person nourished with living foods and operating as a sovereign citizen in a free world eating living foods is like taking the red pill because over time it opens up a whole new perspective on the fabric of reality it sets you free to think for yourself but eating processed junk foods is like taking the blue pill because it keeps you trapped in a fabricated reality where your life experiences are fabricated by consumer product companies who hijack your senses with designer chemicals like msg that fool your brain into thinking you re eating real food if you want to be alive aware and in control of your own life eat more healthy living foods but don t expect to be popular with mainstream mental health experts or dieticians they re all being programmed to consider you to be crazy because you don t follow their mainstream diets of dead foods laced with synthetic chemicals but you and i know the truth here we are the normal ones the junk food eaters are the real mental patients and the only way to wake them up to the real world is to start feeding them living foods some people are ready to take the red pill and others aren t all you can do is show them the door they must open it themselves in the mean time try to avoid the mental health agents who are trying to label you as having a mental disorder just because you pay attention to what you put in your body there s nothing wrong with avoiding sugar soy msg aspartame hfcs and other toxic chemicals in the food supply in fact your very life depends on it oh and by the way if you want to join the health experts who keep inventing new fictitious

up scuffles and brings sick tummies to the nurse she writes your child s report cards and meets with you for parent teacher conferences starting january        she took her dedication one step further and began eating the same lunches they eat why because someone needs to raise awareness about what exactly american children are being served in the school cafeteria every day inspired by an unpalatable bagel dog she was forced to munch on when she forgot to pack her own lunch one day the    something mrs q not her real name made a new year s resolution to cell phone blog every meal live from cafeteria a somewhere in the midwest ok illinois but she won t get any more specific than that that bagel dog was particularly bad i thought i don t want to eat this i can t believe we expect kids to eat this and then go back to class and focus on what they re teacher is saying in march alone mrs q downed    school lunches four pizza slices three burger like meals three chicken entrees two chilis one hot dog one pasta dish one cheese croissant one cheese lasagna and a mac n cheese for good luck all alongside seven fruit cups six servings of carrots two each of pears bananas beans oranges green beans and fruit jello and a serving each of tater tots they count as a veggie corn broccoli and a fruit icy considered a fruit her blog fed up with lunch the school lunch project has blown up recently thanks to a good morning america spot and a bevy of other media interviews her face and voice are always obscured recent posts include a meatloaf and mystery greens entr e that was so malformed she posted a pic and asked her readers to help id the foods an uber boring day    beige and yellow menu consisting of chicken nuggets carrots a corn muffin fruit jello and milk i can t remember how this meal tasted even just a couple hours after i consumed it i have no idea what flavors were present when i ask my students what did you think of your lunch they give me a blank stare now i get it and a guest post by an american teaching esl in south korea who described that school lunches there always include rice soup meat vegetable kimchi and sometimes fruit she graciously agreed to take out from her full time elementary school teaching job blogging and motherhood to speak with never say diet and answer some questions here are the qs we asked mrs q how are today s school lunches different from what you ate as a child i really can t believe how strange some of these lunches are i wanted to show the world what our kids were eating because these were nothing like what i ate in elementary school we used to have pizza just baked and served off those massive metal sheets or grilled cheese sandwiches my favorite because they came with a bowl of hot tomato soup but what these kids are eating it seems like the quality had gotten worse there s all of this packaging and no cooking really goes on it s all just heated up in large ovens how did we outsource the making of a pb j to a company why can t we spread the peanut butter on a piece of bread ourselves why do this now this issue is important now because the child nutrition act is being reauthorized and debated in congress right now i realize that everyone is strapped for cash right now individuals companies states and countries are losing money no matter what is going on in this world we can t forget the kids and the fact that many of them are at the mercy of school districts and corporations for their daily meal s it will cost the us more money in the future in the form of healthcare costs if schools don t address the big problem that is staring them in the face every day childhood obesity no matter how great a school is it can t control what the kids eat outside of school but still schools can do better for kids while they are in the building what has been the worst meal you ve tried there were two meals i did not like at all one was a prepackaged peanut butter and jelly on this sort of thick cracker sandwich i actually threw up that night when i got home but that day i d been paranoid about eating so many school lunches so i had taken a vitamin on an empty stomach and that may have done it the other was a lasagna that came in this little container but it didn t have any form it sort of came apart was clumpy that was one of the meals i could barely eat how about any favorites i m really into comfort food and we like to make pasta at home so the pasta dishes have been good for me even the meaty sauces haven t been too bad mrs q doesn t typically eat red meat aside from this project they also have a chili dish that was actually quite good do you get any fruits and veggies the schools have to offer a cup and a fourth of veggies carrots corns beans peas broccoli they re steamed and sometimes overcooked tater tots and fries count as a vegetable because they re potatoes and they always have to offer a fruit unfortunately a fruit cup or a fruit jello counts as fruit or these icy fruit bars these kids when they get their lunch they just eat that they don t have enough time to focus on all the food and just eat that because it s most appealing have you noticed any health changes since you started i had cut out a lot of milk from my diet last year because it was causing me a little gi upset i d have some milk with breakfast but that was it with this project i started drinking this whole pint of milk every day and was uncomfortable and made the connection that i m lactose intolerant i had a blood test done in december for health insurance purposes i m going have it redone at the end of the school year as far as weight i was into the project so i was eating all the food gained a pound that first month but since then have lost   pounds so i haven t gained any weight i think the portion control of the lunch is helping it s like a calorie restricted diet i do find myself fading mid to late afternoon at work and i m pretty hungry by      pm i keep snacks in my car that i nibble on while driving home i eat almonds walnuts and cashews as well as granola bars the nuts give me protein to fill me up and balance out my blood sugar so that i can make it to

       " 'one year ago in april      i read an article by gary taubes in the new york times magazine that scared me straight off sugar and i did it cold turkey until then i d never dieted in my life in fact i loved every dessert known to humankind with impunity i d scarf the richest cr me brulees dulce de leche cakes and fruit pies slathered in whipped cream it was unthinkable to knock back my ritual cups of coffee every morning without brown sugar or a pile of sourdough toast without a thick layer of preserves i loved finishing french meals with the plateaux des deserts or better yet le chariot des deserts that came wheeling up after an already rich meal i remember all these desserts fondly but i haven t had any for a full year when i gave up sugar i wasn t thinking about my weight blood pressure or any of the many unanticipated things that have happened to my body in the past year i stopped eating sugar only because the possible long term metabolic effects of the stuff as discussed in taubes article were scary enough that i thought i d run an experiment on myself by giving sugar abstinence a shot it s been a year of complete surprises all of which are reported below but there are a few things i should disclose up front first this is a personal account i m not a doctor and i can t suggest that what has happened to me will happen to everyone second i have no threatening health conditions like diabetes which dictated this choice third i am an almost non consumer of alcohol which is directly related to sugar consumption for many people so i haven t had to change a drinking pattern and last i m not a purist i know there s sugar in ketchup for instance but i still use it occasionally and even though i read package labels carefully and avoid sugary items in restaurants i know it s used as a flavor enhancer in all kinds of hidden ways i continue to eat out a lot and do the best i can also to be completely candid i broke the diet twice once to sample a dessert in korea that i d never seen before and another time when i had dinner at my partner s family reunion and didn t want to make a fuss by turning down cousin theresa s amazing four hour meringue my painful and instantaneous physical reaction to that tower of meringue was shocking more later so this is a short list of results from my year off sugar the blood tests and hard data i hadn t given much thought to my middle aged paunch but    pounds quickly melted away i rarely weigh myself so it wasn t the bathroom scale that tipped me off it was that suddenly my clothes ballooned around me my pants were sagging and my shirts were drooping now i m down from an xl shirt size to an l and my waist is down three or four inches the weight loss happened in the first five sugar free months and i ve stabilized since then i m enjoying tucking in my shirts the blood work which i had done seven months into the diet was also interesting because i could compare hard results from tests done two years earlier my triglyceride count lowered from     a high normal to     glucose levels descended from an above normal     to an entirely normal    and my blood pressure has gone way down from hovering in the almost hypertensive range of        to        sleep to my amazement on night number two off sugar i slept through the entire night i hadn t had eight hours of continuous sleep since i was a young teenager and couldn t believe that this had anything to do with my new routine but the pattern has maintained this year has been my most restful in the past    years the main change is that i can fall back asleep when i wake up at   a m this thrills me energy level i frequently do day long presentations to groups the uncomfortable and precipitous mid afternoon energy drop off has disappeared in fact my energy level stays constant throughout the day and into the evening i ve always had high energy but these days i surprise myself focus i m aware of being far more able to focus on a task and get it done my tendency toward distraction has reduced dramatically what i would now describe as jittery nervous energy after big doses of sugar through the day has been replaced by a sense of focused calm cramps a few months into my sugar free life i realized that i hadn t had any leg or foot cramps since the diet began serious cramping had been a constant problem for years mostly happening suddenly and painfully at night i had no idea how sugar and leg cramps were related so i began to talk about it to the doctors with whom i work about half of them said my cramp less nights were unrelated to sugar intake the other half believe that it is directly related having to do with well regulated glucose levels in the cells of my leg muscles a month after realizing the cramps had disappeared i was confronted by a dessert i couldn t easily refuse not wanting to seem picky or demanding in front of greg s relatives whom he hadn t seen in    years i knocked back cousin theresa s mound of whipped cream and berry filled meringue frankly it was delicious and i was enjoying myself thoroughly until an epic and extremely painful charley horse in my thigh levitated me off my chair it took    minutes of limping around in front of the house to ease the cramp it was the last time i knowingly ate sugar if i had previously doubted the impact of sugar all doubts now disappeared the sweetness was simply not worth the pain there have been a couple of other surprises first it s been easy to stay off sugar after a day or two the urge to add sugar disappeared unsweetened coffee was the biggest challenge but i can now taste the sweetness of milk and the coffee is just fine also my urge to eat other carbohydrates has been significantly reduced i used to be able to throw down a couple of bowls of pasta at one sitting but now i have trouble finishing one bread is tasty but i m eating it in smaller quantities my sugar free future looks bright and in fact not a lot has changed i ve always eaten a lot of fruit i love fresh food and have always stayed away from prepared stuff and fast food it has become a lot easier to say no to sugar a lot of people are doing it and the world of desserts is bright too i ve converted what was once a caloric eating experience and one that i enjoyed a lot into an aesthetic experience early on in this year of sugar abstinence i realized that i had eaten almost every dessert in the world with great detail and delight i can tell you exactly what they taste like did i really need to consume another chocolate  clair or slice of tres leches cake or coconut cupcake really not so now as i sit in restaurants and watch my friends eat those beautiful confections i focus on what they look like on the plate their rich color beautiful design and complex fragrance i enjoy the smiles and sighs of appreciation from my dinner companions and i notice how well i feel and have no intention of ever going back for more by rick foster click

       " 'now if you re watching your weight you should stop reading right now as these blue cheese scalloped potatoes with chipotle and bacon are not exactly waistline friendly but believe you me they are luxuriously good the inspiration for these came from a quick trip to texas last week it had been a few years since i d seen the bluebonnets and when a cheap last minute fare to austin presented itself to me i immediately booked a flight my vague notion was that i would drive around central texas and would be blown away by all the wildflowers the reality however was a bit less spectacular as the weather had been dry and not many flowers had popped out of the ground just yet as i spoke to people in the various small towns i visited i heard that the best bluebonnets were to be found in north texas with an exceptionally fine showing in ennis so even though my plan had been to spend my brief time in texas in the hill country i changed course and headed north after a night s rest i woke up before dawn and drove to ennis arriving just as the sun was rising i d found a map of the bluebonnet trail and began to make my way to the areas marked as being especially lush the reports did not lie i d never seen such a spectacular showing of bluebonnets narrow winding roads curved around farms with rolling hills and pastures blanketed in blue i don t know if the area s farmers plant seeds or if these bluebonnets are wild but the display was breathtaking at one point i stepped out of the car and could see nothing but fields and flowers for miles and miles save for an occasional house or cow there were no other signs of civilization i felt like the pioneers must have felt when the first saw texas in all of its wild unfettered glory before heading back to austin for my flight home i stopped at a small town caf  the kind of place where the walls are covered in football uniforms and the waitress greets you with a hearty hey hon on the board cream potatoes were listed as one of the vegetables of the day i ordered them thinking that the potatoes would be sliced potatoes baked in a creamy sauce but instead they were just mashed potatoes though very good mashed potatoes as they were full of lovable lumps which told me they were made from scratch but you know when an idea gets into head and you can t shake it out well that s how it was with the potatoes i suddenly had a crazy craving for scalloped potatoes so when i returned to new york my first order of business was to at last make the creamy potatoes that i had hoped to eat in texas in my fridge i had some blue cheese so i added that to the potatoes and as i always have bacon and chipotle chiles i also threw them in as i figured they d play well with the other ingredients it took a couple of tries to get this right i don t recommend putting heavy cream in a blender with garlic and chipotle chiles unless you want to make chipotle garlic butter but once i figured it out i was extremely satisfied as i said earlier this is a dish that is probably best saved for special occasions such as easter or other family gatherings that said it takes little time to prepare and if you re looking to live a little large you can t go wrong with these potatoes made just a little fancier with blue cheese chipotle and cream blue cheese scalloped potatoes with chipotle and baconingredients

western cities to their knees by ben ellery published       est   december      updated       est   december      down the years and across the universe the heroes of science fiction classics from dan dare to star wars and the matrix have fought intergalactic battles with weapons that wipe out enemy electronics at the touch of a button now scientists have turned fantasy into reality by developing a missile that targets buildings with microwaves that disable computers but don t harm people aircraft manufacturer boeing successfully tested the weapon on a one hour flight during which it knocked out the computers of an entire military compound in the utah desert pre programmed filghtpath aircraft manufacturer boeing has successfully tested a missile which knocked out an entire military compound in the utah desert it is thought the missile could penetrate the bunkers and caves believed to be hiding iran s suspected nuclear facilities but experts have warned that in the wrong hands the technology could be used to bring western cities such as london to their knees during boeing s experiment the missile flew low over the utah test and training range discharging electromagnetic pulses on to seven targets permanently shutting down their electronics boeing said that the test was so successful even the camera recording it was disabled codenamed the counter electronics high power microwave advanced missile project champ it is the first time a missile with electromagnetic pulse capability has been tested for security reasons boeing declined to release film of the test but instead issued an artist s impression of it on video in the clip a stealth aircraft deploys a missile that emits radio waves from its undercarriage which knock out the computer systems inside the buildings below stealth mission the missile is launched from a stealth bomber and is thought to be able to penetrate the bunkers and caves believe to be hiding iran s suspected nuclear facilities the company did release real film showing a row of computers that can be seen shutting down when the electromagnetic pulse is switched on although the project is shrouded in secrecy experts believe the missile is equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon this uses a super powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy which causes voltage surges in electronic equipment rendering them useless before surge protectors have the chance to react keith coleman champ programme manager for boeing s prototype arm phantom works said the technology marked a new era in modern warfare he added in the near future this technology may be used to render an enemy s electronic and data systems useless even before the first troops or aircraft arrive we hit every target we wanted and made science fiction into science fact when the computers went out it actually took out the cameras as well it was fantastic the project has cost    million and has been developed on behalf of the us air force research laboratory following a request from the pentagon four years ago lead test engineer peter finlay said we re not quite at the place where the star trek and star wars movies are but this is definitely an advancement in technology able to give us an opportunity to do things we could not do before james dodd vice president of advanced boeing military aircraft said there was a real need for a weapon that could knock out a target but not cause harm to people and structures he said we know this has capabilities and impact we re trying to see if we can get it implemented sooner rather than later however experts fear that the project could create an arms race with countries scrambling to build their own electromagnetic pulse weapons wiped out boeing s film shows computers before left and after right the attack by the drone but experts have warned that in the wrong hands the technology could be used to bring western cities such as london to their kneesprofessor trevor taylor professorial fellow at the royal united services institute said the western world would be much more vulnerable to such an attack because of our increased reliance on electronics he added this is a challenging area in political and military terms ideally there would have been an arms control agreement to cover this field because once technology is actually developed control becomes harder the historical record shows that important technologies developed in one country are developed elsewhere within a relatively short period look what happened with regard to the ussr and nuclear weapons should the us be known to have developed such a technology to the production stage it would drive others to try to act similarly western countries are more dependent on electronics based it than others and would be vulnerable to extensive disruption aircraft manufacturer boeing has created a weapon that can knock out computers by targeting buildings with microwaves that disable computers but

       " 'when steve jobs launched the first ipad in      he did so against a backdrop of uncertainty its arrival came with the typical predictable fanfare apple devotees queued around the block to get their hands on it while technology blogs and news websites including this one prodded excitedly at it is this the future of computing everyone wondered back then nobody really knew the answer it was a mood best summed up by a simple remark from bbc website reader ian mears i must admit i want one he wrote but i don t know what i d actually do with it yet the numbers do not lie two years and over    million units later apple can rightly claim to be king of the tablet market but as apple chief executive tim cook launched the new ipad he did so facing a different kind of uncertainty less cool today s doubts centre on whether the apple s device can remain at the top of the tablet tree judging by the reaction of the technology watchers at the london media event apple has done just enough for now i think they ve done a good job to give first generation ipad owners a reason to upgrade says carolina milanesi lead apple analyst for gartner and also to all the people who felt a little less cool now than they did an hour and a half ago that s what apple does aside from the unsurprising addition of the retina high quality display of particular interest was the addition of  g lte technology a method of receiving data far faster than the ipad s existing  g capabilities but for buyers in the uk this speed boost remains out of reach the country s telecoms regulator ofcom is still planning a  g mobile spectrum auction by the time the networks roll out next year the next ipad may have been unveiled despite the frustrations this may cause to some uk owners ms milanesi predicts that it will not prove too damaging to sales if it was at a higher price people might have said why bother she says most people will still use their own wi fi and although we re not going to see lte they have optimised hsdpa an enhanced  g protocol so even to a uk consumer it should see some improvement slamming samsung at present most of the ipad s competitors come in the form of google android powered devices mainly from samsung and motorola mr cook attempted to deal with this head on with a cockiness designed to delight the apple watchers in attendance while also antagonising the creators and perhaps the owners of the samsung galaxy tab reeling through apps such as twitter on the samsung device mr cook claimed to have demonstrated the inferiority of his rival it is no coincidence some would say that this show of bravado comes at a time when apple and samsung remain locked in ongoing patent legal battles nevertheless even one of samsung s product strategy managers recently admitted honestly we re not doing very well in the tablet market according to a recent cnet report even so experts are keeping a close eye on the galaxy note which is sized somewhere between a tablet and a smartphone the firm has already shipped more than two million units while not all of those will equate to sales the figure is considerably better than some doubters predicted the south korean firm is targeting    million shipments by the end of the year but turning back to tablets one company that may pose more of a challenge is apple s long time rival microsoft the firm enjoyed a high profile and well received launch for the preview of its windows   operating system last week the system will offer users the same functionality on their pc and tablets come christmas time the big battle in the consumer space will be microsoft versus apple with google pushed to the side predicts stuart miles of pocket lint gartner s ms milanesi agrees saying that the multi platform windows   operating system will have apple looking over its shoulder i do think that overall microsoft is going to be a more serious contender than android simply because i still don t understand what google wants to achieve their focus around revenue coming from advertising takes them away from caring about the device the experience and what comes with it amazon s appeal however it may be too early to write android s prospects off the operating system already accounts for nearly    of the us smartphone market according to a recent study by comscore time magazine and wired have reported rumours that a google branded seven inch tablet may launch later this year running the new ice cream sandwich version of the software and undercutting the ipad in price offering the firm a fresh opportunity to appeal to owners of phones using its system amazon s kindle fire appears to have proved that there is an appetite for a budget priced tablet the firm has not released detailed sales figures but analysts at isuppli have estimated that it shipped     million devices in the us over the last quarter of      accounting for a      share of the market if accurate that would make it the sector s second biggest player behind apple whether it will prove vulnerable to the discounted ipad   which remains on sale remains to be seen blackberry s struggle the most exposed company may prove to be canada s research in motion rim the firm recently released version     of its blackberry playbook software providing fully functional email contacts and calendar apps that its tablet previously lacked it also offers users the opportunity to run android software radically extending the amount of programs available but some analysts fear the company may still struggle to ignite interest and predict more bad news when it releases its next results on    march apple may sell more of the new ipads in two days than rim will have sold playbooks over the whole of its fourth quarter says colin gillis senior technology analyst at bgc partners in new york it s possible that the firm may have even had more returns than sales they lost the high end to apple the low end is owned by amazon and the

       " 'here s how to make low and slow smoke roasted last meal ribs on just about any covered grill and make slabs better than they do in restaurants you ll never boil ribs again that s because water is a solvent and it pulls much of the flavor out of the meat when you boil meat you make soup you wouldn t boil a steak would you if you boil ribs the terrorists win there s nothing revolutionary in this method envision a proto human tribe padding warily through the fragrant ashes of a forest fire as they follow a particularly seductive scent when they stumble upon the charred carcass of a wild boar they squat and poke their fingers into its side they sniff their hands then lick their greasy digits the magical blend of warm protein molten fat and unctuous collagen in the roasted meat is a narcotic elixir and it addicts them on first bite they become focused obsessed with tugging out the rib bones and scraping them clean between their teeth moaning and shaking their heads the aromas make their nostrils smile and the flavors cause their mouths to weep they sing praises to their gods now imagine your tribe your family and friends moaning in ecstasy and praising your name in your own backyard you can make it happen if you follow my step by step guide below i share this with you after years of studying at the feet of the masters judging at barbecue competitions including the jack daniel s world championship international barbecue and sucking on a lot of bones we re talking southern ribs here a style created by african slaves and as uniquely american as their other great contributions to our culture jazz and the blues the ribs that win championships are a melange of flavors spice rub hardwood smoke tangy sweet sauce all underpinned by the distinct flavor of pork they are juicy and tender and they tug cleanly off the bone they do not fall off the bone they have the texture of other properly cooked meats like steaks click here to see what i look for when i judge rib cookoff what i consider to be amazing ribs there may be a few more steps in this process than you like but it s not hard and we re talking blue ribbon competition grade meat here if you love ribs follow these steps and you will thank me as so many others have serves   adults preparation time overnight dry rub marinating is optional cooking time we will be cooking low and slow so allow   hours for st louis cut ribs my faves and   hours for baby back ribs hardware   grill with a cover you can use a dedicated smoker or any charcoal grill or gas grill as long as it has a cover a tight fitting cover with adjustable vents like those on the weber kettle is best      pound bag of charcoal for charcoal grills or smokers you won t use all that charcoal but because you will need more on cold windy or wet days than on sunny and warm days have a full bag on hand hardwood lump is best but regular briquets will do fine absolutely do not use the instant igniting stuff that has solvent in it chimney starters are by far the best way to start charcoal especially for long slow cooking where the smell of the solvent in charcoal starter fluid can ruin the taste of the meat   tank of propane for gas cookers you won t need it all but until you get the hang of this technique don t risk running out by starting with a partial tank   ounces by weight of hardwood chunks chips or pellets it doesn t matter how many slabs you are cooking   ounces should be enough i prefer chunks of apple oak or hickory for pork never use any kind of pine unless you want meat that tastes like turpentine never use construction lumber because it is often treated with poisonous chemicals to discourage rot and termites you do not need to soak the wood wood does not absorb much water that s why they make boats with it   pair of long handled tongs   sauce brush preferably one of those newfangled silicon brushes    feet of heavy duty aluminum foil not the lightweight stuff   good instant read thermometer preferably digital   six pack of beer for the cook not the meat   lawn chair   good book tunes software   slab of fresh st louis cut slc ribs that s     slab per adult if you use baby back ribs get a whole slab per person you may have leftovers but what s wrong with that slcs are the meatiest and most flavorful ribs they are spare ribs with the tips removed so they form a nice rectangular rack you can use baby back ribs if you prefer they are smaller and cook faster country ribs come from the shoulder and are not really ribs so don t use them for this recipe get fresh not frozen meat if possible fresh meat has the best pork flavor and the most moisture ever notice the pink liquid when you defrost meat you can t get that back into the meat so buy fresh meat whenever possible ask the butcher to remove the membrane on the back side   tablespoons vegetable oil   tablespoons of meathead s memphis dust or a similar spice rub   cup apple juice   cup of your signature homemade barbecue sauce or a good commercial barbecue sauce do this   rinse rinse the ribs in cool water to remove any bone bits from the butchering and any bacterial film that grew in the package don t worry cooking will sterilize the meat pat dry with paper towels   skin n trim if the butcher has not removed the membrane from the back side do it yourself insert a butter knife under the membrane then your fingers shown at right work a section loose grip it with a paper towel and peel it off finally trim the excess fat from both sides click here to see more photos of how to skin n trim   rub coat the meat with a thin layer of cooking oil sprinkle enough meathead s memphis dust to coat all surfaces but not so much that the meat doesn t show through that is about   tablespoons per side depending on the size of the slab many of the herbs and spices in the rub are oil soluble so the cooking oil will help them penetrate a little better spread the memphis dust on the meat and rub it in wash your hands wrap the meat in half the foil and let it sit in the fridge for at least   hours on a platter or pan to catch leaks in addition to flavoring the meat the salt in the rub pulls the juices to the surface and that will help form a crust during the cooking if you don t have time to let the meat marinate in the dry rub it s not the end of the world put on the oil and rub anyway and start cooking   setup for indirect   zone cooking that means that one side is hot and the other is not if you have a gas grill use only one burner as described in my article setup for a gas grill put a disposable aluminum pan with water on top of the hot burner moisture and combustion gasses in a propane grill combine to create a seductive baconlike flavor in the meat if it has only one burner put the water pan between the meat and the burner if you have a charcoal grill push the coals to one side as in the photo at right and as described in best setup for a charcoal grill you can use a water pan but it is not necessary if you have an offset firebox smoker follow my instructions for an setting up an offset smoker if you have a bullet smoker like the weber smokey mountain read my article bullet smoker setup   adjust the temp preheat your cooker to about    f and try to keep it there throughout the cook adjust the air intake dampers at the bottom to control heat on charcoal grills intake dampers are more effective than exhaust dampers for controlling the temp because they reduce the supply of oxygen to the coals take your time getting the temp right cooking at    f will allow the meat to roast low and slow liquefying the collagen in connective tissues and melting fats without getting the proteins knotted in a bunch it s a magic temp that creates silky texture adds moisture and keeps the meat tender if you can t hit    f get as close as you can don t go under    f and try not to go over    f click here for more about meat science and the thermodynamics of cooking   smoke for charcoal or gas cookers add   ounces of wood at this time put the wood right on top of the flame of a gas grill or on the hot coals resist the temptation to add more wood nothing will ruin a meal faster and waste money better than oversmoked meat you can always add more the next time you cook but you cannot take it away if you oversmoke   relax put the slabs in the cooker on the cooler side of the grill meaty side up close the lid and go drink a beer and read a book   more smoke when the smoke disappears after       minutes add another   ounces of wood after the first hour stop adding wood adding wood at the beginning of the cook allows better penetration before the meat surface seals itself if you have more than one slab on halfway through the cook you will need to move the ribs closest to the fire away from the heat and the slabs far from the flame in closer leave the meat side up there is no need to flip the slabs otherwise keep your lid on opening the lid just upsets the delicate balance of heat moisture and oxygen inside your cooker it can also significantly lengthen the cooking time no peeking if you re lookin you ain t cookin   the texas crutch now we employ another secret of the champions the texas crutch after   hours of cooking st louis cut ribs at    f       hours for baby backs take   of heavy duty foil and fold it into a   length lay the slab on the foil meaty side up fold up the sides making a boat and pour   cup of apple juice into the boat don t pour it on the meat or you ll wash off the rub now carefully fold the foil around the meat sealing it tight and trying hard not to puncture the foil be careful those bones can poke through put the packet back on the grill for       minutes no more than    minutes by creating a little steam the texas crutch adds flavor moisture tenderness and finishes cooking the meat if you want to skip this step feel free you ll still have killer ribs    sauce now take the meat out of the foil being careful not to curl your eyebrows with the steam when you open the packet and place the ribs back on at    f for another hour to firm up the surface then paint both sides with your favorite home made barbecue sauce or storebought sauce and move them directly over the hottest part of the grill in order to caramelize and crisp the sauce on a charcoal grill just move the slab over the coals on a gas grill crank up all the burners on a water smoker remove the water pan and move the meat close to the coals on an offset smoker put a grate over the coals in the firebox and put the meat there with the lid open so you don t roast the meat from above sizzle the sauce on one side and then the other one coat of a thick sauce should be enough but if you need two go ahead but no more don t hide all the fabulous flavors under too much sauce if you think you ll want more sauce put some in a bowl on the table if you ve done all this right you will notice that there is a thin pink layer beneath the surface of the meat this does not mean it is undercooked it is the highly prized smoke ring caused by the combustion gases and the smoke it is a sign of amazing ribs now be ready to take a bow when the applause swells from the audience optional instead of using barbecue sauce make vermont pig candy shown at the top of this page this is always a huge hit here s a summary of the process pour the apple juice from the foil into a sauce pan and mix it with     cup of real maple syrup not artificially flavored pancake syrup and cook it about    minutes on medium high heat or until it starts to foam watch it carefully and take it off the moment it foams then add   pinches of salt and   teaspoons of hot sauce more or less paint this wonderful glaze on the meat and put it back on the grill over high heat with the lid open and watch it carefully because it can burn easily the moment it begins to sizzle and bubble turn it and sizzle it on the other side serve it and wait

       " 'august        we don t spend hours in the kitchen every evening sometimes i just pop a bowl of cold fried rice into the microwave for a quicker than quick dinner on tuesdays my mother and i steam broccoli chop watermelon into chunks sit down to watch chopped and call it a night i ve even leaned against the fridge and eaten cold chicken salad straight out of the tupperware our kitchen is always stocked with enough leftovers to make us low maintenance weeknight diners weekends though that s an entirely different matter sometimes the whole day revolves our food my mother often wakes up before me to brush her bread with an egg glaze and we juggle the oven so i can bake biscuits she s the queen of scrambled eggs and freshly squeezed juice and i can press any berry into a special maple syrup my parents and i frequently head to the farmer s market right after breakfast to shop for dinner usually without a meal plan in mind we pick whatever s fresh and seasonal and bright whatever inspires hunger even though we just ate my family has been known to spend an afternoon rolling out pasta directly on our dinner table marinating fish picking through sun warmed herbs then we feast don t be fooled though there are plenty of awful mistakes pain in the rear ingredients and even the occasional temper our kitchen is what my dad likes to call a two butt work area the three of us barely fit inside it and with the two dogs brushing against our ankles it s a very tight squeeze usually it s chaotic frustration as the sky darkens my dad works from both the stove and the cutting board on opposite ends of the kitchen my mother can t help but clean dishes in real time sometimes whisking bowls off into the sink before we re through with them and me i m just trying to get to the oven which is between the two of them add tilly who begs at your feet until you step on her and otis who grunts whenever you drop a scrap it s an experience yet once we carry plates to the table settling down in our usual chairs it s calm it s relaxed it s all about passing plates and trying a bit of everything it s the subdued mmm at first bite cooking together is hectic but it s always worth it there is something intangible about a meal created with your family an hour of satisfaction and a lifetime of memories usually when i m in the kitchen i m alone sometimes i m even the only one in the entire house especially now in the summer i love baking in the serene calm of morning with light streaming from the window above the sink and the french doors it s quiet except for blue jays rustling in the backyard pines and the faint rhythm of my breath it s silent enough for me to sense the song of the kitchen in my ears and in my soul when i m baking by myself the kitchen is perfect for one person spacious even i can t help but feel that there s no better way to spend life than alone with my thoughts and my kitchen aid that is until the weekend rolls around again then i m weaving between my parents half laughing and half exasperated five minutes away from dinner s ready and at that moment there s no other place i d rather be they re opposite situations and i like that i like the contrast and the fact that such distinct experiences can occur in the same room the differences make each experience memorable and sweet even if they don t seem to complement each other at first glance i love juxtaposed differences in life and in food sweet with salty hot with cool creamy with crunchy enter these watermelon bars the perfect example of just that the bottom layer is the simplest watermelon sorbet a snap to whirl together it freezes somewhat hard and icy but it s utterly refreshing the sorbet is spread with a basil lime semifreddo which is one of the most delicious things i ve ever made the semifreddo makes up for all the richness the sorbet lacks whisked with sweetened condensed milk and lightened with whipped cream it s so thick and creamy it should be illegal the zing of lime and smooth floral aroma of basil pair gorgeously with melon it could be a clash of flavors and textures but i think they make a beautifully balanced combination together they pack the epitome of summer in every melting bite i d had these chilled bars in the back of my mind since i first saw them in gourmet magazine two years ago i finally froze a batch because i had a hunk of watermelon in the fridge and a bag of limes perfuming the counter i threw in basil my favorite herb since it reminds me of everything summer my dad didn t like the bars as much as i did but only because he felt the two frozen desserts could be paired differently he suggested multiple thinner layers of sorbet and semifreddo for a multi layered bar or perhaps for a swirled scoop of ice cream both great potential variations on this dessert the flavors in the bars are very bold especially the citrus don t be afraid if you know you re not a fan leave out the lime zest in the semifreddo i

       " 'allowing nurses to act as primary care providers will increase coverage and lower health care costs so why is there so much opposition from physicians reuters think it takes a long time to get an appointment with a primary care provider now brace yourself it will likely only get worse we re facing a severe shortage of primary care physicians in the nation the association of american medical colleges predicts a shortfall of        primary care physicians by      and        by      mainly because of the anticipated increase in demand for services from the affordable care act aca deterrents to entering the field such as relatively lower incomes and growth in the general population and specifically growth in the elderly population should the aca pass muster with the supreme court next month an additional    to    million previously uninsured americans will be covered and even if aca is not implemented in full and in the end merely expands medicaid it will add    million to the insured ranks by      one of the best ways to alleviate this shortage is to expand the scope of practice for advanced practice registered nurses aprns well trained registered nurses with specialized qualifications who can make diagnoses order tests and referrals and write prescriptions aprns could provide a variety of services that primary care physicians now provide the definitive word on medical practice in america the highly respected and impartial institute of medicine iom of the national academy of sciences has weighed in on this idea of allowing aprns to do more in a landmark      report the future of nursing the iom conducted an exhaustive review of all the available studies of the efficacy and safety of care provided by aprns and concluded that properly trained aprns can independently provide core primary care services as effectively as physicians they can provide wellness and preventive care services diagnose and manage common uncomplicated acute illnesses and help patients manage chronic diseases such as diabetes in its report the national academy of sciences recommended that a dvanced practice registered nurses should be able to practice to the full extent of their education and training but despite an urgent need and clear evidence that aprns can complement and extend primary care providers roles without sacrificing quality of care nurses are only permitted to practice independently to the full extent of their training and competence in    states and the district of columbia the remaining states impose regulatory barriers that limit their scope of practice these barriers should and can be removed but the turf wars of organized medicine are preventing progress the american medical association the american osteopathic association the american academy of pediatrics and the american academy of family physicians all oppose expanding the scope of nurse practitioner responsibilities despite the iom report and recent research demonstrating that an expanded scope of practice for aprns has no impact on primary care physician income in colorado where there are far too few anesthesiologists available for rural and critical access hospitals the state s medical and anesthesiologists societies sued to overturn former governor bill ritter s      decision to allow certified registered nurse anesthetists crnas to provide anesthesia and pain management care in these hospitals instead they prefer to make people travel hundreds of miles out of their communities to have a procedure that a crna is licensed and trained to carry out they are also apparently fine with hospitals being forced to close as a result of a lack of anesthesiologists this is a classic example of doctor centric care trumping patient centric care apparently the physician organizations are threatened by some mix of concerns about lost income and their traditional position as captain of the ship those opposed to expanding the scope of nurses practice also argue that physicians with more years of training under their belts must necessarily know more than an aprn ever could of course they know more but it is well established that they do not know more about providing the core elements of basic primary care and why primary care physicians already overburdened and overworked wouldn t want some support with routine care and services is puzzling allowing well trained aprns to handle routine care frees up physicians focus on diagnostic dilemmas and more complex management issues while dramatically reducing waiting times for care expanding nursing scope of practice not only can help fill the gap in primary care providers but it can save money as well rand estimates that in massachusetts using nurse practitioners to their full capacity could save the state between     and     billion over ten years other studies find sizable savings from care provided by nurses in clinics in retail pharmacies in these cases aprns have the authority to diagnose treat and prescribe medications among other services also tapping nursing s potential is the fastest and least expensive way to meet growing demand for primary care nurses can be trained faster and for a lot less than medical school costs between three and    nurses can be educated for the price of one doctor there is hope employers and patients are beginning to clamor for progress in this area and the turf wars may lose steam as we move away from fee for service and toward accountable care organizations in which a team of providers takes responsibility for the well being of a population in return for global rather than provider specific payments the federal trade commission may provide a further nudge it has weighed in on a handful of states efforts to restrict nursing s scope finding cause for anti competitive practices and in some cases evidence that the restrictive laws protect professional interests rather than consumers the remaining    states that restrict aprn s scope of practice will eventually have to come to terms with a growing shortage of physicians and increasing demands to save money and restructure how we receive and pay for health care the inconsistent often punitive and highly politicized regulatory environment surrounding aprns must recognize the new horizons in medical care in the united states allowing nurses to act as

the batch nice slightly chewy as we like them with a pleasing depth in taste yum they packed a neat bite not sure how you toast your walnuts almonds etc but i now fast track that too in the microwave for     minutes keep an eye on them give them a quick stir halfway through and they are toasted enough cool and chop my ergo chef knives work like a charm here by the time the oven was preheated the

gypsies tents read very dusty i go there often you can see some more of my shopping on this guest post here mr pab is a man of patience i walked from one dusty tent to another from the side of my eyes i could see the car crawl along no pressure nothing nice i bought a few battered wooden boxes rushed home dusted washed sun dried and oiled them used one for the butterscotch brownies above the old gypsy who sold them to me was h a p p y and rushed to get his hookah when i asked if i could take some pictures had my p s in my bag look at him no pressure of the daily grind enjoying what he was

the beginning of the chef revolution young cooks stopped cooking what was expected and started cooking what they wanted to eat the resulting meat centric balls out approach was both exciting and refreshing bringing with it some of the last decade s most astonishing food suddenly spice salt fat offal cult seafood items and stinky cheese became the norm restaurants that    years ago would have seemed like risky business propositions became the model for many young chef owners you must have livers you must have uni you must have octopus belly meat bacon in places where no bacon has gone before this is certainly the tradition claimed by eric park the young chef behind black hogg in silver lake black hogg opened last march with an aggressively meat centric menu a sparse and tiny storefront space on sunset no liquor license and a setup where you had to trek through the kitchen to get to the bathroom the place was a hit from the get go packed on most nights despite the lack of booze in august black hogg closed to prepare for a liquor license which required a renovation mainly having to do with the lavatory situation it reopened in november with a more traditional bathroom setup beer and a short wine list as his press coverage had it park is an alumnus of the french culinary institute in new york and a guy who d worked in both april bloomfield s seminal new york nose to tail gastropub spotted pig and eleven madison park one of the country s best restaurants impressive right yet the truth is a little trickier park s most vaunted jobs eleven madison park and the spotted pig were both brief part time noncredited internships while he attended fci outside of these internships and his nine months in culinary school park has only a couple months of real restaurant employment the kind you get paid for the kind you would call experience there s absolutely no reason to hold this against him but it does explain quite a bit about black hogg spotted pig is an obvious inspiration for park s cooking although even spotted pig isn t quite so aggressively meat focused meaning vegetables are a strong point on bloomfield s menu along with the pork belly and pig ears but the one true vegetable focused dish on park s menu is also one of his best brussels sprouts and yukon gold potatoes topped with a poached egg the brussels twice cooked so the flurry of shattery leaves on the outside gives way to a soft inside the bacon vinaigrette brings the dish together with an acid tang balancing and harmonizing egg and acid make an appearance also on the b hn m  a deeply satisfying sandwich of mortadella capicola p t  and a vinegary slaw topped with a runny egg purists will complain that    could buy you as many as seven b hn m  at any of the city s best vietnamese b hn m  houses but this sandwich is highly edible nonetheless then comes the deep fried bacon called popcorn bacon on the menu it s a small dish holding cubes of bacon breaded and fried served with maple crema it s fat fried in fat served with a side of sugary fat here s where black hogg really starts to go off the rails where the ingredients and trends of the day are taken to extremes without an ounce of subtlety and presented as delicious simply because they exist chopped chicken liver on toast is good right how about we make it spicy spicy food is good right how about we top it with chicken skin cracklin because cracklin is good right never mind that the spice and salt obliterate the magnanimous creamy nature of the livers and never mind that livers alone are almost impossibly wonderfully rich and that adding more intense fat and salt in the form of a cracklin takes it so far overboard that it loses all that s good and right and amazing about a chicken liver the same is true for the uni toast two quivering globs of santa barbara sea urchin served on grilled bread with plugr  butter scallions and salt all that makes uni the strange magical ingredient it is all its sex and funk and creamy subtlety is lost in the textural heavy handedness of the butter and bread all you taste is the harsh carbon of a hot grill meeting buttery bread the soft touch of the ocean is obliterated much goes outrageously overboard here in a way that s almost fun and then not fun at all the meat for a lamb burger is ground with butter for a burger that literally gushes fat not just the butter in the meat why but blue cheese as well it s a flavor bomb for sure but more than a little off putting the one vegetarian dish is a huge slice of brioche soaked in brown butter with crimini

       " 'if you resolved earlier this month to work smarter stop procrastinating and be more productive your best intentions may have quickly been subverted by your regularly scheduled work routine workplace performance expert jason womack says changing the way we do our work to improve our productivity is hard because our processes have become habit and in many cases these habits have made us successful even if they drove us to the edge of sanity in the process a mid level manager for example has probably gotten in the habit of living by the ding of email or the buzz of the blackberry says womack and they ve probably been rewarded for their responsiveness if they haven t addressed that pavlovian response it will be difficult for them to shift their habits the biggest mistake professionals make when it comes to time management adds womack is continuing to use their time for activities that no longer deserve it they keep going when they should be done he says they keep typing an email when they ve already answered a question in the subject line they keep talking on the phone when they ve already addressed the purpose of the call they stay in the meeting room after the meeting points have been covered to prevent you from making those same mistakes womack shares six of his most effective time management and productivity boosting tips   stick to the    minute rule womack recommends organizing your workday into    minute chunks if you work eight hours a day you ve got       minute chunks a    hour workday gives you       minute chunks womack emphasizes    minutes because he says it s long enough to get something done and short enough to find in your day when you have to schedule a meeting or conference call that would typically take an hour womack tells his clients to start it at    minutes past the hour and to end it on the hour he believes people can accomplish in    minutes that is three    minute chunks what they think they need    minutes for containing the meeting to    minutes forces you to keep it on point and gives you an extra    minute chunk in which you can address another item on your to do list   know when you re done continuing to work on something when it is essentially done is a significant time waster that most professionals aren t even aware of people need to think through the when am i done question says womack who is also the author of your best just got better work smarter think bigger make more wiley      when i get a nonfiction book i m done with that book when i ve learned something from the author that i didn t know before he says i ve picked up books paid       read it for two or three    minute chunks learned something and given the book to my seatmate on a plane   eliminate distractions eliminating distractions may not be a new time management tip but womack s advice for avoiding specific distractions such as a niggling coworker or a nagging manager is novel and effective if your manager is prone to interrupting you with questions womack suggests preempting her for example instead of waiting for your manager to show up at your desk or ping you approach her first at a few minutes before the hour say a       or       am ideally before a meeting or call he says to tell her i have a bunch of things i m working on and a meeting at    and i m trying to get any interruptions out of the way do you have anything you need to tell me or ask me before my meeting and before my work gets underway another tip from womack if you have a quick question for someone but don t want to get caught up in a protracted conversation around it call your contact or stop by his desk a few minutes before the hour knowing that he might have a meeting on the hour and won t have time for chit chat either   identify verbs that need attention womack recommends organizing your to do list around verbs such as call draft review prepare and schedule those are tasks you can generally complete in one sitting and that help move a larger project forward he says if you have big picture verbs on your to do list such as plan discuss create or implement replace them with action steps that break down the big picture project adds womack doing so will help you get started and reduce any feelings of being overwhelmed   be prepared for bonus time the next time you find out your flight s been delayed or your doctor is running late don t get annoyed recognize that you ve just been given the gift of bonus time if you bring some work with you wherever you go as womack suggests you ll have the chance to tackle it whether that s responding to email making a call reviewing a proposal or drafting a plan   use email shortcuts womack notes that both the blackberry and iphone allow users to create quick keys or keyboard shortcuts when using the smartphones for email he created several keyboard short cuts that call up boiler plate text that he frequently reuses for example if someone emails womack asking him for information on how to use microsoft outlook more effectively all he has to do is type his shortcut ol which automatically populates his email with a response to the question this video demonstrates how to create these keyboard shortcuts on an iphone  s these shortcuts save womack a ton of time since he s developed several for answers to some of the most common questions people ask him it prevents him from having to recreate the answer every time someone emails him it also saves him from having to search his sent folder and having to copy and paste the answer into email productivity  if you resolved earlier this month to work smarter  stop procrastinating and be more productive  your best intentions may have quickly been subverted by your regularly scheduled work routine ',\n",

       " 'the government has to plan for every contingency disease famine political instability drought weather aliens the plot of armageddon coming true and protecting super evolved man from his primitive cousins there are actual plans for every one of those scenarios there are entire real government programs devoted solely to thinking up ways to counter weather themed supervillains and other outlandish threats normally relegated to the realm of science fiction like these   talking to or covering up extraterrestrials are we alone if not what will happen when we finally meet creatures from another planet will they be peaceful hostile will we be able to mate with them captain kirk style if not why not seriously why not one reason these are questions movies and television shows have been asking for decades and somewhat inexplicably the government has been as well it s not so far fetched after all while the chance of finding life out there other than ourselves is infinitesimal we have been trying it for years we ve been sending radio waves into space with seti voyager   has reached the edge of our solar system and is still moving out into deep space and we pretty much call all alien life forms pussies in countless movies that we then beam out in every direction it s practically inevitable that they re coming this film will be the blackface of the   th century so what is the government doing about it way back in      when americans were first getting a boner for all things to do with space hereby shortened to the space boner era congress commissioned an official report on what sorts of things could happen once we launched ourselves out of earth s atmosphere this was called proposed studies on the implications of peaceful space activities for human affairs or the brookings report because psipsaha is kind of a sucky acronym it sounds kind of like the noise you make when you stub a toe most of the report was pretty snooze worthy but there was one section called implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life that made people sit up and take notice and then void their bowels upon reading such reassuring findings as if superintelligence is discovered the results become quite unpredictable there are many examples of societies sure of their place in the universe which have disintegrated when they had to associate with previously unfamiliar societies how might such information be presented to or withheld from the public yep the whole thing pretty much reads like an x file all it s missing is a righteously indignant mulder screaming about the truth while giving sultry looks to the camera doo dee da da dee doo but america is far from the only nation worried about meeting et even the vatican is devoting serious thought to an idea formerly relegated to trailer parks and hill folk father jose funes speaking for the vatican after its official conference on astrobiology wait what stated that the church has concluded that the existence of life on other planets would not invalidate anything in the bible and guy consolmagno one of the pope s astronomers wait double what said that he would be delighted to baptize any extra terrestrial life that comes his way but only if they asked and promised to put the probe down first   leaving warning messages for humans of the far future major civilizations come and go over the course of history even ones that dominate for thousands of years will eventually fall into dust but they always leave shit buried in the dirt since the statute of limitations for littering is probably just short of a few thousand years we accept that fact and use these leavings to study them one day in turn somebody will be studying us the same way what our early ancestors needed with one fingered gloves we may never know and we re probably going to kill them for it see unlike previous civilizations where the biggest worry was uncovering somebody caught rubbing one out while vesuvius erupted our society is capable of leaving things that will stay dangerous basically forever like yucca mountain the giant soon to be glowing mound in nevada and america s possible storage facility for nuclear waste if we do end up dumping tons of radioactive material there any future people or aliens who dig it up are going to seriously regret messing with the past hey it s like we re setting up our own mummy s curse awesome bjorn no one would go to the trouble of hollowing out a mountain if they weren t hiding some real cool shit so what is the government doing about it assuming that we are an altruistic people and don t want the people of the future to all die horrible deaths although they do kind of seem like dicks all smug with their hyper cars and stupid transmogrifiers we need a way to warn them where not to dig so it s a good thing the u s department of energy has been paying people to think about this issue for years what s so hard about that though just slap up a sign explaining the damn thing and be done with it the only problem being that the environmental protection agency has demanded that the warning signs be visible and understandable by anyone who might seen them for the next        years iconography cultural touchstones and language will all be entirely different in        years communicating anything to people of the far flung future is nearly impossible for example according to the government our current nuclear waste symbol sort of looks like an angel it could be misconstrued as a religious sign or a message of peace right up until they start digging into all of our poisons eh either an angel or lady gaga s tomb palace so we can t mark nuclear waste sites with that sign lest we want future us s children doing snow angels in rotten plutonium that s why the department of energy gathered a group of intellectuals from a huge variety of backgrounds including history risk analysis and engineering to brainstorm solutions to the problem dubbed the futures panel they came up with ideas like the landscape of thorns a visual warning made up of gargantuan    foot tall concrete pillars with spikes jutting out of them that or else just littering the place with human bodies because subtlety does not translate well over millennia of course as with most government projects the bad ass ideas were discarded for cost restrictions if the yucca mountain project goes through the current plan is to build large earthen berms in layman s terms piles of dirt to warn people of the future because large piles of dirt might not be foreboding understandable or long lasting but man are they dirt cheap ha ha but seriously you ll die if you fuck with that dirt future you guys know what this would be good for storing drinking water   fighting asteroids with robots asteroids fly past earth with a slightly worrying frequency especially since we don t know most of them are even there until they pass us the sun literally blinds astronomers to their presence so the chances of us knowing that one is on a collision course is infinitesimal so what do we do if we ever actually have a window of time when we know the big one is coming personally we re going to go with big drunken orgy of crime followed by panic and crying stock up on tear gas and molotov mixins early to take advantage of the best deals fortunately the government has a different plan so what is the government doing about it unfortunately it s straight from the plot of armageddon a group of concerned astronauts from the u s and canada have presented the u n with a report detailing the need for an asteroid impact contingency indeed the astronauts claim that we already have all the technology necessary to go all armageddon on any bitch ass asteroid fool enough to step to us given enough time that is what s enough time an astonishingly unlikely    years heads up in some cases that s how long scientists would need for the safest plan which involves using mirrors or lights to deflect an asteroid off course just enough to miss us currently the shall we say less safe plan is to land people or robots if they re advanced enough for the task by then but not advanced enough that they realize it s a batshit insane plan on the surface of the asteroid then yep it unfolds exactly like the movie the astronauts drill inside the rock and detonate a bomb to slightly change the massive rock s trajectory in theory saving the human race of course if the bomb is too effective we ll just get lots of smaller but still deadly asteroids changing the space bullet into more of a space shotgun blast but hey there are always kinks to work out the big downside there s a bigger downside than space shotgun blast is that even with the resources of the most advanced countries in the world at their disposal scientists still predict the human race needs at least    years to prepare in that case it s a good thing they re working on it now we already know there is a possible contender for the plan headed our way in      and again in      there are entire real government programs devoted solely to thinking up ways to counter weather themed supervillains and other outlandish threats

       " 'for the past   days ann taylor has been having extra    off sale items both in stores and online no code needed some things that i spotted at my local store prices are probably cheaper in stores than online i wanted to share some of my at sale shopping tips and lessons learned finding quality pieces at low prices can be a tedious process but sometimes it s worth it especially for those on a budget using stylefinder if you have been eying something and your store doesn t have it jot down the   digit style from their website go to or call any store and ask them to look for it at other stores using the stylefinder system note final sale items cannot be located using stylefinder the best time to call is right when stores open for two reasons   inventory systems update from the prior night so if you call later in the day the system might show that something s in stock when it has already been sold   it s less busy and the store is neatly organized so sa s are more likely to help search shipping if you have an at or loft credit card shipping of full priced items via stylefinder is free even if it s on promo ie    off full priced items shipping of marked down items ie there is a sale sticker on the tag is      beware of price differences ann taylor now has different sale prices for different store locations boo i learned this the hard way when trying to buy this lovely white textured linen pencil skirt as seen on kelly before the extra    off it is currently    in boston     in another store    in a third store and    online thus even with the      shipping fee it can be cheaper to order from another store unfortunately stylefinder won t tell you the prices at other stores and it defaults to the closest store that has the item you can give the sa alternative zip codes i tried one from the midwest with success then one of you have to call to ask what the price is there a few petite favorites from spring are currently on sale for very fair prices if you can manage to locate them from my old post the luxe chambray shirt style        is now    the golden texture pencil skirt style          p is tiny bit big on me is    and the exotic belt in limelight style        is    readers any good finds or shopping tips to share ',\n",
       " 'live a balanced life learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day some robert fulghum editor s note this is a guest post from anastasiya goers of balance in me do you sometimes wonder whether your life is in balance it is easy to know if you lead a balanced life because if you do then you enjoy every moment and every second you can cope with any difficulties you can be happy without any reason to be happy you can be yourself and love the person you are today the world constantly tries to throw you out of balance and sometimes no matter what you do you still feel like your life is going in the wrong direction i know i feel this way sometimes balanced living might seem like one of those theoretical terms that nobody can put into practice but in fact there is nothing simpler than living a balanced life it might take some work at first but once you get in the flow and discover the simple ways to steer your life in your desired direction you will feel empowered you will be inspired and energized by every day of your life your life will be full of amazing adventures and events that will make every day memorable you won t be wasting your life anymore or spending gloomy hours contemplating about the misfortunes that might have happened on your way does balanced living mean that your life will be full of only positive people and events that will bring you happiness every moment of your life not at all balanced living is when you can always offset any negative events in your life with positive ones it is also when you can see the light at the end of the tunnel balanced living is when you are happy working and playing equally if you picture happiness and everything great in your life as a diamond then any negative things that may happen are just the setting that makes this diamond shine only brighter if you want to live a balanced life then there are   essential habits that you need to develop awareness and mindfulness awareness is the key to balanced living because it lets you see every moment of your life and appreciate it a mindful person lives in the present and does not get obsessed with the future or the past it s important to plan for the future and learn from your mistakes in the past but it is even more important to appreciate who you are right now and find joy in this state when you are aware of this moment you are calm and you do not make any decisions that you might regret later when you are mindful you are in balance with the universe appreciation of your body by appreciation i mean taking care of your body if you are grateful for the very first gift that you received in your life your body then you must take care of it it means making healthy choices in life exercising and being generally active eating a balanced and healthy diet letting your body rest when it s tired and pampering it every once in a while your body is the tool that lets you experience so many wonderful moments in life and you need to do your best when taking care of it clearly balanced living is not possible without a balanced body creativity every day we face a lot of challenges and choices in life some of these challenges might be easy while others will be more difficult if you approach each of your challenges with creativity then your life will be filled with adventures conversely if you turn off your creativity then your life will turn into torture creativity is a wonderful tool that lets us turn our dreams into reality turn play into work and work into play and enjoy life even when it seems empty creative people are the ones who can make the exquisite setting for the diamond of their life patience with patience we can overcome almost anything whilst without it we can ruin almost anything patience can help us turn our dreams into reality losing weight starting a business or blog it can help us be better parents spouses friends and even strangers sometimes a smile from an understanding stranger can make the biggest difference when you are having a bad day if you are patient you do not have to worry about the minutes spent in traffic or in the line at the grocery store with patience you can see results in all your endeavors and you do not have to spend the precious time of your life getting mad or infuriated patience leads to mindfulness and mindfulness brings you in balance simplicity simplicity is probably the most important part of life balance when you build your life around simplicity you reduce the number of out of balance things that can disrupt your happy living in balance everything is simple there are two opposites like black and white and you just have to pick something in the middle simplify you work schedule so that you do not have to think about a hundred things at the same time simplify your relationships by connecting with people you truly care about and getting rid of the ones you don t simplify your diet by choosing simple healthy ingredients that are part of balanced nutrition simplify your social media exposure and enjoy living life and getting things done rather than wasting time online simplicity makes life balance simple these habits have been my lifeline for many years and i cannot imagine a balanced and happy life without them living in balance is easy and very rewarding because your life becomes the one of joy happiness and serenity if you put some time and effort into turning your life into a balanced direction then you too will live a truly zen life read more from anastasiya at

       " 'we re also going to need a set of wires fortunately this is an area where modern snack foods excel there is quite a selection of wire shaped extruded food and we get our pick of it first these are fruit streamers fruit snacks in the shape of a ribbon cable with wires that can be pulled apart neat while these purport to be polychromatic the blue and green strands can hardly be told apart and the opacity leaves something to be desired none the less here they are haribo licorice wheels are a good source of red or black wire the rolls are very long and give you by far the longest wires that we had to work with downside they tend to retain a serious curl even after dereeling note we aren t sure why the red ones presumably made in the same factory are so much smaller maybe that s how you re supposed to tell the genders apart or something air heads xtremes sweetly sour belts what the heck is it so far as i know belt is not the name of any type of food none the less these exist and were in the candy aisle i therefore infer that these are actually meant to be eaten while the colors are bright and the components do separate this was just awful to work with the sticky surface texture left you feeling like you d just been handling salted fluorescent bacon yuck they didn t even get the colors of the rainbow in the right order if you leave it intact it might make a good looking ribbon cable but it s probably not worth the hassle these twizzlers twisted berry wires er candy strands turned out to be the nicest to work with disgusting yet great very bright opaque visible strong and can be neatly spliced on the down side it would be nice if they were longer they can be easily separated right into bright red and blue parts there are also dull purple wires along for the ride here we have an assortment of roll candies sweetarts necco wafers lifesavers gummies lifesavers   flavor lifesavers wint o green these are to various degrees good raw materials for making cylindrical components like resistors or capacitors on the right is one of our failed experiments it s a stack of necco wafers where the colors are picked to make a resistor brown black yellow gold or     k   the stack is held together with layers of icing while this is an easy approach it just doesn t look that good that s because the color saturation of necco wafers is poor and their inconsistent shape leads to large gaps between neighboring wafers perhaps a better use for the necco wafers would be as ceramic disc capacitors we made most of our resistors by creating stacks of four wint o green life savers held together by icing once the icing has set just a few minutes you can use food coloring to paint the rings with the appropriate color code brown black yellow gold in this case the great things about this technique are   it leaves a hole to put your wire through and   the white candy surface takes most colorations very well there are certainly a lot of other ways to build resistors and keep in mind that there is a lot of variation amongst even standard resistors on the right is a set of food coloring pens that we used to help color in the lines on the resistor these are like the ones that we used to write on hearts but with a broader tip this mixture of licorice candies simply boggles the mind not only are there the usual licorice allsorts but gummy bears and even gummy frogs it looks like it s whatever fell off the side of the conveyor belt in the factory that makes the haribo licorice candies the most unusual ones are interesting a variety of odd shapes that look a lot like the odd shapes of capacitors that are available with the help of some pretzel sticks you can take any one of those strange candy coated licorice bits and turn it into an electrolytic capacitor with radial leads we recently found these haribo brixx which are thankfully not actually brick flavored what s interesting is that if you slice these thin they make a great model of a certain type of capacitor regular old marshmallows while these can be used for many different purposes in circuitry snacks there are a few places where they really excel as battery cells as large electrolytic capacitors and when painted with a suitable set of colored stripes resistors on the right you can see one dressed up as a c cell an icing bump was added to one end of the marshmallow before painting that end orange two other building blocks that we have found to be generally handy miniature marshmallows and tootsie rolls these miniature marshmallows come in a variety of pastel colors but white will work just as well they can be used in a variety of ways as small electrolytic capacitors as inductors as glass passivated components like diodes and if painted suitably as resistors in a circuit tootsie rolls are sculptable raw material for which the possibilities are endless for some earlier designs we wrapped colored licorice bands around them to make resistors with color codes what is a jujube we ve always heard it pronounced joo joo bees but the spelling looks like it should read joo joobs regardless these hard little translucent cylinders are a bizarre suspension of sugar starch and mineral oil hence the fat free logo they look a little bit like leds or the lenses that go over them if you wanted to build the edible equivalent of an led matrix these are your best bet the translucent quality also lends them to play the role of glass encapsulated diodes on the right are several  n    small signal diodes that we ve assembled from pretzel sticks icing food coloring and either a jujube or a miniature marshmallow dots are little gumdrops that look like regular sized t       leds if you stand them up on two toothpicks or pretzel sticks the prominent led in the picture at the top of the photo is one of these much like leds regular dots come in red orange yellow and green if you want the elusive blue ones you have to look hard in this case we found them in the box of tropical dots there is also a second variety of black colored dots called crows crows are essentially identical in shape and size and look like infrared leds or phototransistors any number of chocolate bar like foods can be made into edible versions of integrated circuits kit kat twix and mini charleston chews are small components that make good models of integrated circuits in long skinny packages chocolate covered graham crackers are another good option the aspect ratio is good for doing large scale models of e g   pin dip packages these are the ones that we made into    s the fudge sticks are neatly rectangular layered wafer cookies with a thin chocolate coating it s kind of like a kit kat bar in the limit where the cookie goes to unit volume where the chocolate coating goes to zero volume because they are so neatly rectangular they make a good medium size chip actually they don t taste half bad either to make these chocolate bar like items into chips use hard icing to add a legend to the top a marker by pin   and the correct number of pins to the edges be sure to do this on waxed paper or parchment paper so that you can unstick the legs after they harden the smaller chips here are charleston chew based quad op amps tl    the two attiny    s shown here are based on a fudge stick and a kit kat the three     chips at a different scale are made from chocolate covered graham crackers with icing detail twizzlers nibs short black pieces of licorice with a d shaped profile perfect for making those little to    shaped food projects e g a  n     transistor here we ve written the designation on the surface it s very tricky to squeeze out icing that fine we ve also added three toothpick feet toothpicks are not strictly speaking food however they are often allowed as structural component to assemble food an even better trick is to avoid the use of toothpicks at all by making edible legs for your components you can do this by making rigid icing rods lay down even stripes of icing on parchment paper and allow to dry overnight pick them off the parchment and use icing to attach them where they need to go in this case we ve made a transistor by sticking several of the solidified icing sticks to the bottom of the licorice piece this way it s fully edible much better than using toothpicks let s start putting some boards together on the left is a simple board featuring a full size kit kat made into an avr atmega    we have supplied this board with power connections via the ribbon cable in the board on the right we have an attiny     a tl    quad op amp and a  n    diode for both of these boards we are modeling the circuit as a printed circuit board where the components are visible but the traces on the printed circuit board are not it s certainly sufficient detail for most folks to recognize this as a circuit board the next step is to make the logical leap to designing a detailed circuit out of edible components what s better than a     led blinking circuit a     led blinking circuit that you can eat to make this we started with the graham cracker circuit board two    k brown black yellow resistors and one     ohm orange orange black all made from lifesavers the     is a chocolate covered graham cracker the   uf ceramic disc capacitor was formerly a nilla wafer the  v battery was made from a fun size three musketeers bar the red led came out of a box of dots and all the wiring is twizzlers berry wire all soldered together with hard icing this circuit is the starting point for a lot of good things for example the cylon pumpkin the next circuit that we re building here is a joule thief a simple boosting power supply that can run a blue led from a single     v battery that s a neat trick since it usually takes at least     v to run a blue led this circuitry snack contains a marshmallow battery a   k brown black red resistor a bifilar wound toroidal coil wound around a sushki like a hard miniature bagel cookie a  n     transistor and a blue led so we ve walked through some of the snack food choices that seem promising for circuitry snacks how to assemble them into simulated electronic components and how to put them all together on an edible circuit board what other cool ideas for candy circuits can you come up with we re looking forward to seeing the results ',\n",

jackson mississippi but it is popping up in new york next week too for those of you living in the big apple for those of us not lucky enough to finger through the rails full of vivetta tba alexandra grecco dear creatures and more we ll live vicariously through her collaborations one of which i was lucky enough to be a part of jaclyn sent me this beautiful tba dress to style and photograph i was initially worried about it s sleevelessness given both the cold and my dislike for showing my arms irrational i know but that was soon remedied by my botm blouse of the moment of course it s charming print is what makes it so special adorned with ballerinas and swans it brought me back to my ballet days which i unfortunately quit after grade   but remember it with fondness i would turn up with a mess of black eyeliner and a band t shirt over my leotard not the typical ballerina i know when giving the old pointe shoes a try taking these pictures i realised what hard work it was and how out of

bubbles new nail varnish kebab and exploring a city in heels less than    hours in a city doesn t really give you a proper feel for it but i experienced a taste as shini and i burned off the calories consumed at our extravagant german breakfast put on by zalando we came across endless beautiful design shops and cafes dotted about the place berlin has a very artistic feel to it perhaps contributed in some part to the graffiti daubed on most surfaces which certainly gives it identity it s almost east london complete with kebabs which i couldn t help but try unfortunately for my waistline kebab is my favourite takeaway but i did branch out from my favourites a bit i drank my first bubble tea not something i ll be trying again in a hurry i can assure you we tried to fit in as much as possible making our way to the brandenburg gate and back popping in to far too many expensive boutiques on the way that might be why the only purchases were made in american apparel of all places i d love to return for a more relaxing stay and check out a few of the many museums and galleries we passed the place is full of history and i m sure there is much more to it than street art and kebabs see you again berlin and a huge thanks to zalando for having me x dress a p c blouse new look shoes urban outfitters tights topshop bag yesstyle uk march  th      practising my german if you follow me on twitter you ll have seen that i spent a couple of days last week in berlin this was all thanks to the wonderful zalando who invited myself and several other bloggers over for the launch of their first collection whilst i love clothes i could never turn down the chance to travel somewhere new this was my first time in germany a place i d wanted to travel since grasping the basics of the language back at school many years ago ich bin einundzwanzig jahre alt etc etc i didn t get to put it to much use though my partner in crime shini was the first to put to practice her language skills leaving me with the polite danke sch n as we hopped out of the taxi unfortunately i don t have many recommendations we spent the most part of the two days wandering the streets discussing different cultures and architecture whilst looking for a place to eat junk food but i would thoroughly recommend the hotel we stayed in my room witnessed silly photoboothing the endless search for something english on tv and a very comfortable bed but i ll have more about the city in the next post for now let s talk clothes the zalando collection i swapped my loafers for heels brushed my windswept hair and put on a bit of lippy for the main event the launch of zalando s new collection and pop up store it was packed to the brim with trendy people speaking a plethora of languages so shini and i found a spot in the corner to take goofy pictures in the mirror the collection itself was dotted around the space in pretty pastel tones but with a sporty edge not immediately my thing i thought until i got looking and found some gems a sky blue vest with a new take on the collar and summery court shoes in a variety of pastel hues they had artists creating murals on the temporary walls using tape the vibe was

heavy jackets and trendy practical outer wear these british pioneers of fashion couldn t do it much better although despite forever being in my top five favorite labels i was slightly off put by the boys use of tartan this season i m unsure as to what it is that i don t really like about tartan possibly the memory of myself running around in a tartan pleated mini skirt at age fourteen dreaming of being some kind of punk rock chick or the fact that i continue to have a love hate relationship with red clothing on my pale complexion these personal issues with red tartan aside however it would be wrong to say that they haven t done tartan well the use of tartan red and royal blue pays homage to the boys british roots in a way that is uniquely rag and bone the use of such milky light colours juxtaposed with bold red and blue hues in new york s darkest season also challenges the traditional new yorker s all black winter wardrobe that so many designer s tend to favor some key pieces in the collection including the leather bomber jacket and thin shaggy fur jackets offered a practical alternative to leather biker s and coats while the duo s use of heavy layering continued to remain one of the collections key themes the dark eye makeup and messy loosely braided hair also helped to keep each look effortless despite the complexity of the layering and although there was little attention paid of accessorizing the thin golden chain necklaces proved enough to make all of the difference source style com wednesday february         posted by elegantly wasted the blogger s and photographer

was the absence of some of his favorite faces unlike in his previous shows there was no abbey or freja but hanne karmen and liu wen still remained three of wang s favorite faces however this wasn t the only visible change or growth in wang s fall collection after the rapid expansion of his t label wang sought to create a strong point of different between his high end and lower end labels through his use of such fabrics as angora chiffon and silk making this fall collection the definition of luxurious chic and whilst being somewhat luxurious the traditional leather biker pipe thin pants and angora coats all continue to reflect his traditional model off duty aesthetic as for the accessories they were few and far between which wasn t overly surprising given the copious layers one wears in fall although there s always the shoes the pointy brogue esque metallic heels paired with the pink royal blue and charcoal sparkling pants are my favorite i can t say the same for the fur heels in deep red however which looked more like high end slippers to me rather than something i d be rocking with my jeans next winter but all in all there s not much else worth complaining about it s

thought doesn t really fit the oyster mould despite being a face that you would see in other australian publications such as vogue and harpers bazaar i hardly see bingle as kill me for using this word alternative put simply oyster is a far more independent and artistic magazine than those of which you would probably see bingle in and even then you d probably see her in the social pages even rather than an editorial but still equally as likely to be wearing that new season patent burberry biker at the same time however the sense is there or in the changes of editors at oyster this month as

       " 'my mom loves regis philbin growing up she d watch regis kathie lee religiously she even once went to a shopping mall somewhere on long island to get kathie lee gifford to sign a copy of her book these days she and my dad tivo regis and kelly in the morning and watch it at night i m a view man myself though whoopie is no rosie i miss the compulsively watchable hysteria of rosie vs elizabeth but once i went to a taping of regis kathie lee almost ten years ago because my friend dana was harrison ford obsessed and he was the featured guest why am i telling you all this because if you d asked me last week who are the last two people you d expect to have the key to unlock the mysteries of one of new york s greatest cookies i would not have said regis philbin and kelly ripa and yet thanks to this post on eater new york it became evident last week that if i wanted to make momofuku milk bar s compost cookies at home the recipe was right there on regis kelly s webpage for those not in the know and for those who missed this post two weeks ago the momofuku milk bar compost cookie created by genius pastry chef christina tosi is an explosively rich and buttery cookie packed with the most unexpected flavors pretzels potato chips rice krispies and chocolate somehow all those flavors and calories work together to produce an unforgettable cookie one that when you eat it at the actual location makes you think to yourself i could never make it this good at home but you can thank you reeg it s actually pretty easy a traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe with one unexpected step normally when you make chocolate chip cookies like my favorite ones here you beat together the butter and sugar you add eggs and combine then add the dry ingredients and finally the chocolate here that middle step combining the butter the sugar and the eggs goes on for ten minutes you let it whip on medium high speed and the batter becomes intensely pale and takes on a glossy sheen it s kind of incredible then after that you add your dry ingredients and then the wacky stuff i was conservative this first time around adding only crushed pretzels and chocolate but these cookies were such a hit in fact my neighbor rob the culinary cardiologist said and i don t believe him but he said it i m not making this up these are almost slightly better than the ones i ate last week at the actual momofuku milk bar i know what a nut don t listen to him he s crazy that i feel bold enough to experiment further next time around i m definitely adding potato chips now those of you nowhere near new york can experience the momofuku milk bar compost cookie phenomenon yourselves at   am tomorrow morning you know who to thank the momofuku milk bar compost cookierecipe by christina tosi courtesy of regis kelly s website ingredients   cup butter that s two sticks unsalted   cup granulated sugar    cup light brown sugar  tbsp corn syrup note i left this out not because i m against corn syrup i just didn t have it the cookies came out fine though may have had a nicer sheen with the syrup   tsp vanilla extract  large eggs      cups all purpose flour  tsps baking powder  tsp baking soda  tsps kosher salt      cups your favorite baking ingredients options chocolate chips raisenettes rollos cocoa krispies       cups your favorite snack foods chips pretzels etc note as said above i used chopped up bittersweet chocolate and crushed pretzels next time i d definitely add potato chips   in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment cream butter sugars and corn syrup on medium high for two to three minutes until fluffy and pale yellow in color scrape down the sides with a spatula   on a lower speed add eggs and vanilla to incorporate increase mixing speed to medium high and start a timer for    minutes during this time the sugar granules will fully dissolve the mixture will become an almost pale white color and your creamed mixture will double in size   when time is up on a lower speed add the flour baking powder baking soda and salt mix       seconds just until your dough comes together and all remnants of dry ingredients have incorporated do not walk away from your mixer during this time or you will risk over mixing the dough scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula   on the same low speed add in the hodgepodge of your favorite baking ingredients and mix for       seconds until they evenly mix into the dough add in your favorite snack foods last paddling again on low speed until they are just incorporated note eating this cookie dough raw is dangerously good   using a   oz ice cream scoop i m not sure how many ounces mine is but it worked well portion cookie dough onto a parchment lined sheetpan   wrap scooped cookie dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of one hour or up to   week do not bake your cookies from room temperature or they will not hold their shape   heat the oven to     f take the plastic off your cookies and bake   to    minutes while in the oven the cookies will puff crackle and spread at   minutes the cookies should be browned on the edges and just beginning to brown towards the center leave the cookies in the oven for the additional minutes if these colors don t match up and your cookies still seem pale and doughy on the surface   cool the cookies completely on the sheet pan good luck before transferring to a plate or an airtight container or tin for storage at room temp they ll keep five days  my mom loves regis philbin  growing up  she d watch regis   kathie lee religiously

       " 'i rarely bake breakfast treats but after tasting these muffins i think i may be doing it more often i adapted a recipe from annie s eats a great food blog for everything from appetizers to dessert and found a recipe that caught my eye these muffins were great for not only breakfast but they also made for a satisfying dessert with a scoop of icecream while i found the recipe on annie s eats the muffin recipe originally comes from williams sonoma and was exactly what i was looking for in a muffin the recipe made about    muffins and the batter came together very quickly after baking the end result yeilded golden muffins with a crisp topping gently covering their light and fluffy texture the light and tender crumb is thanks to the use of buttermilk in the batter as noted i opted to use a basic crumb topping instead of dipping the muffins into melted butter and then into a cinnamon sugar topping as called for in the original muffin recipe and i am more than pleased with the results besides who needs a muffin dipped in melted butter the muffin itself has a slightly sweet and subtle cinnamon flavor and bakes up with a moist tender and fluffy crumb i felt it was a nice contrast to the sweet brown sugar and cinnamon crumb streusel that gives the muffins a crisp top and gorgeous appearance sure to impress company if needed next time i may add some chopped toasted walnuts to the batter or the topping for a little extra flavor punch i would highly recommend these the next time you have some buttermilk to use up or are just looking for an easy and flavorful

       " 'until just a few years ago doctors believed that the brain stopped making new neural connections meaning that the memory began to get irreversibly worse when the body stopped developing usually in the early   s and doctors knew that like any other part of the body neurons weaken as people age loss of brain function due to neural breakdown was assumed to be a normal unavoidable part of aging it turns out they were wrong in the past few years it has become clear that you can in fact make new neurons starting in your   s and continuing well into old age you can literally rewire the brain with new parts as the older parts wear out how there are lots of things you can do right now to preserve protect and enhance your gray matter  physical exercise a healthy body really does mean a healthy mind in the last decade it became clear that regular exercise beneficially affects brain function exercise boosts brain power by stimulating formation of new brain cells neurons the process known as neurogenesis  also exercise strengthens connections between those cells researchers have found the areas of the brain that are stimulated through exercise are associated with memory and learning  physical exercise may even help prevent alzheimer s disease several studies    have confirmed that regular physical activity reduces the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in old age  lifelong learning your brain is a learning machine for most of us after we graduate from high school or college our pursuit of new knowledge bottoms out over time we may be masters at what we do but we aren t learning new things there is clear evidence      that education and learning produce favourable changes in the brain researchers believe that intellectual activity play a neuroprotective role against dementia some studies suggest that having a low level of formal education and poor linguistic skills is a risk factor for cognitive decline in later life but if you continue to learn and challenge yourself your brain continues to grow literally recent research   have demonstrated that learning over time enhances memory and the survival of new brain cells an active brain produces new connections between nerve cells that allow cells to communicate with one another this helps your brain store and retrieve information more easily no matter what your age how can you challenge yourself scientists agree that anything that is new and expands your knowledge will be effective learning to play a musical instrument switching careers or starting a new one starting a new hobby such as crafts painting biking or bird watching learning a foreign language according to the latest study speaking more than one language may slow the aging process in the mind staying informed about what s going on in the world learning to cook new dish if you let your brain be idle it s not going to be in the best health  mental stimulation researchers found that a woman s memory can be impaired for at least a year after giving birth although the effects are minor stimulate your brain make sure you re actively problem solving and having to use your memory just as physical activity keeps your body strong mental activity keeps your mind sharp and agile the more we think the better our brains function regardless of age without something to keep us mentally charged our brains like unused muscles can atrophy leading to a decline in cognitive abilities the study  conducted by researchers at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york found that mentally active seniors reduced their risk of dementia by as much as    percent compared to those who do not stimulate their minds researchers from the princeton university   found that simple cognitive stimulation such as bingo can be of great value to the daily management of alzheimer s patients some good ways to stimulate your mind travel going to museums reading books newspapers or magazines play thinking games like cards checkers chess crosswords sudoku puzzles scrabble or doing crossword puzzles playing musical instruments dancing crafts such as drawing painting and ceramics ditch the calculator once in while and forcing yourself to do the calculation volunteering  social interaction people are good medicine social interaction can be measured by how often people talk on the phone with friends neighbors and relatives how often they get together with them how many people they can share their most private feelings and concerns with men are one and a half times more likely than women to develop mild cognitive impairment the transition stage before dementia new research shows socializing may have a protective effect on the brain because it s a form of mental exercise not only does interacting with people stimulate the brain but it can also keep you sharp because dealing with people can be pretty challenging strong social ties have been associated with lower blood pressure and longer life expectancies and having no social ties is believed to be an independent risk factor for cognitive decline in older persons a u s team found   that talking to another person for    minutes a day improves memory and test scores they found that socializing was just as effective as more traditional kinds of mental exercise in boosting memory and intellectual performance they also found that the higher the level of social interaction the better the cognitive functioning social interaction included getting together or having phone chats with relatives friends and neighbors in a study of more than       people ages    or older harvard researchers   found that those with at least five social ties church groups social groups regular visits or phone calls with family and friends were less likely to suffer cognitive decline than those with no social ties  sleep nap sleep plays a crucial role in brain development and growth one of the explanations the science has come up with for the healing power of sleep is that sleep may contribute to neurogenesis the formation of new nerve cells in the brain   new research in animals   provides a clue about how the sleep deprivation harm the brains reduces the number of new brain cells without sufficient sleep neurons may not have time to repair all the damage and so could malfunction during the day sleep is necessary for the brain to process and consolidate knowledge and for memories to form neuroscientists say that during sleep the hippocampus where memory is stored becomes highly active and moves knowledge from short term memory to long term memory      the memories laid down by the sleeping brain are of two kinds declarative memory is memory for information facts dates and names procedural memory is what allows us to do things like play a musical instrument ride a bicycle or add up a bill scientists think these two types of memory are influenced by different parts of the sleep cycle slow wave sleep benefit mainly the consolidation of declarative memories in contrast rapid eye movement rem sleep seems to benefit procedural memory   a    minute midday nap can help boost your memory and remember facts but only if you learned them well in the first place  according to animal studies when you perform a task the brain cells fire in a certain sequence if you then fall asleep the same cells automatically fire in an identical sequence without being distracted or disrupted by incoming visual stimuli there is a consistent pattern learn something new during the day consolidate what you have learned during a good night s sleep then remember or perform the task better in the morning however sleep before learning is also critical in preparing the brain for next day memory formation   even a nap in the middle of the day may benefit some learning according to a recent study  sleep appears to help set the declarative memories and make them easier to recall  stress management the brain uses    percent of our body s oxygen and    percent of its blood scientists believe people exposed to chronic stress tend to have elevated levels of cortisol a hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to acute and chronic stress high cortisol levels are dangerous to the brain some of the most impressive effects of the stress on brain are hippocampus atrophy shrinkage of the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex the area of the brain unique to humans and even neural death in some brain regions      the hippocampus a vital brain region for episodic spatial and contextual memory has many cortisol receptors which makes it especially susceptible to stress severe stress lasting weeks or months can impair cell communication in the brain s learning and memory region   increased stress hormones lead to memory impairment in the elderly and learning difficulties in young adults   latest study provides the evidence that short term stress has the same effect researcher from the university of california   have found short term stress lasting as little as a few hours can impair brain cell communication in areas associated with learning and memory they found that rather than involving the widely known stress hormone cortisol which circulates throughout the body acute stress activated selective molecules called corticotropin releasing hormones which disrupted the process by which the brain collects and stores memories stress is a constant in our lives and cannot be avoided so stress management is the key not stress elimination several ways to help you manage stress in your daily life see problems as opportunities get away from the noise exercise learn relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation cut down on unnecessary responsibilities and avoid over scheduling make time for leisure activities get a massage  laugh humor laughter is the best medicine we ve heard the expression time and again medical world has begun to take more serious notice of the healing power of humor and the positive emotions associated with it by having fun and laughing your stress levels decrease significantly humor stimulates the parts of our brain that use the feel good chemical messenger dopamine   also researchers found that humor improves memory       healthy breakfast it might be the last thing on your morning to do list or it might not be on your list at all however many studies have shown that having breakfast improves the ability of concentration reaction time learning ability mood and memory whereas skipping breakfast reduces people s performance at school and at work      a recent study done at cardiff university in wales found that subjects who ate a high fiber cereal in the morning showed a    percent reduction in fatigue lower incidence of depression and better cognitive skills fiber helps slow down the absorption of food in the stomach so you have more energy for a longer period of time  omega   fatty acids high intake of omega   rich oils such as sunflower or grape seed oil may boost the risk of developing memory problems say french researchers  omega   fatty acids are essential for brain health they provide the physical building blocks necessary for the development and maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the brain in fact one of the omega   fatty acids commonly known as dha docosahexaenoic acid makes up a large portion of the gray matter in the brain and is vital for brain cells function adding more dha to your brain directly influences cell to cell communication affects nerve conduction and neurotransmitter release and other things that allow brain cells to send messages to each other   one      review of studies on dha published in the journal pharmacological research   found that the nutrient is essential to normal brain function and that a diet rich in dha improves learning while a lack of dha causes learning ability to suffer french researchers  looked at the diets of       people older than    who did not have dementia at the start of the study over the following four years     of the participants developed alzheimer s disease and    developed another form of dementia people who regularly consumed omega   rich oils such as canola flaxseed and walnut oil were    percent less likely to develop dementia than those who did not regularly consume such oils the study also found that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables lowered dementia risk by    percent people who ate fish at least once a week were    percent less likely to develop dementia coldwater fish such as salmon tuna mackerel and herring are rich sources of omega   fatty acids just be careful to eat this in moderation due to potential contamination with mercury dutch studies      revealed that high fish consumption may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline   blueberries would you believe that eating this tasty low glycemic superfood every day was found by the usda at tufts university      to slow and even reverse age related brain decline as well as improve short term memory loss and help reverse age related loss of balance blueberries are a major source of flavonoids in particular anthocyanins and flavanols although the precise mechanisms by which these plant derived molecules affect the brain are unknown they have been shown to cross the blood brain barrier after dietary intake it is believed that they exert their effects on learning and memory by enhancing existing neuronal connections improving cellular communications and stimulating neuronal regeneration   vegetables researchers found that eating vegetables appears to help keep the brain young and may slow the mental decline sometimes associated with growing old   cruciferous and green leafy vegetables including cauliflower spinach kale broccoli cabbage brussels sprout and collards appear to be the most beneficial   researchers say that may be because they contain healthy amounts of vitamin e an antioxidant that is believed to help fight chemicals produced by the body that can damage cells three b vitamins folic acid b  and b   can help lower your homocysteine levels fortified cereal other grains and leafy green vegetables are good sources of b vitamins   want to drink choose red wine people who drink to forget bad memories may actually be doing the opposite by reinforcing the neural circuits that control negative emotional memory  while heavy drinking clearly causes serious problems for many people drinking in moderation may be good for the brain researchers found intake of up to three daily servings of wine unlike other alcohol beverages liquor beer was associated with a lower risk of dementia   this may be due to the ability of red wine polyphenols to protect brain cells against alcohol induced damage   there is well documented evidence that resveratrol a polyphenol found in red wine and red grape skin and seeds has a significant antioxidant properties and produces neuroprotective effects     keep health problems under control many medical conditions particularly those identified as risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia high blood pressurehigh blood pressure in midlife increases the risk of cognitive decline in old age   use lifestyle modification to lower your blodd pressure diabetesdiabetes is an important risk factor for dementia   you can improve blood glucose levels by eating healthy diet exercising regularly and staying lean but if your blood sugar stays high you ll need medication to achieve good control high cholesterolhigh levels of ldl bad cholesterol appear to significantly increase the risk of dementia   diet exercise weight control and avoiding tobacco will go a long way toward improving your cholesterol levels high homocysteineresearch has shown that a higher than average blood level of homocysteine a type of amino acid is a strong risk factor for the development of alzheimer disease and dementia     neurobics created by lawrence c katz ph d a professor of neurobiology at duke university medical center neurobics is a unique system of brain exercises using your five physical senses and your emotional sense in unexpected ways that encourage you to shake up your everyday routines studies have shown that even small changes in daily patterns cause brain stimulation neurobics can be done anywhere anytime in offbeat fun and easy ways these exercises can activate underused nerve pathways and connections helping you achieve a fit and flexible mind drive to work a different route get dressed with your eyes closed brush your teeth with the other hand unlock the door with your eyes closed use your opposite hand to dial the phone or operate the tv remote listen to music and smell flowers at the same time shop at new grocery store research has suggested that using your left hand if you re left handed or your right if you re left handed more often can

       " 'it is always important to carry a hand sanitizer when you travel because you may need to use it one of the places that a sanitizer is likely to come in handy is in your hotel room according to a study done by undergraduate students the remote control and the light switch are some of the dirtiest spots in a hotel room university of houston s katie kirsch who led the study expected that the bathroom sink and toilets would be the two dirtiest spots but to her surprise the spots most ridden with bacteria were not anywhere close to the bathroom the findings are as a result of samples taken from    surfaces in three different hotel rooms from different states texas indiana and south calorina kirsch and colleagues from south carolina and purdue universities did tests for levels of aerobic bacteria this included streptococcus staphylococcus and fecal bacteria among other illness causing bugs the surfaces with the most germs in dirty hotels floors sinks remote controls and light switches on average a tv remote control was said to have      colony forming bacteria units or cfu per cubic centimeter squared the light switches in the hotel rooms had a cfu of       and also the highest facal bacteria levels averaging at       cfu the phone keypads were found to be cleaner but still had      cfu aerobic bacteria a hospital cleanliness study on msnbc recommended a limit of upto   cfu for each cubic centimeter squared the team led by kirsch found high bacteria levels in items like mops and sponges in the american society for microbiology s general meeting held on sunday in san francisco kirsch said there is a risk for cross contamination caused by these items this is likely to happen across multiple rooms where these items are used if you use a sponge to clean the toilet then move to the counter where your toothbrush is the bacteria can easily be transferred said kirsch the lowest contamination levels in dirty hotels were found to be on the curtain rods headboards and to the teams surprise bathroom door handles the findings just provided an insight on overall cleanliness in hotels and did not necessarily state that coming into contact with these germy surfaces in dirty hotels would make you sick the study was aimed at providing a preliminary dataset in the hope that it would encourage hotels to adopt hygiene guidelines like the ones used by health care and food service industries kirsch also said that housekeepers clean    to    hotel rooms per every eight hour shift and spend an approximate    minutes on each room housekeeping managers can identify items with high risk of contamination and design a cleaning strategy that would reduce potential health concerns posed by microbial germs in dirty hotel rooms efficiently overall kirsch maintains that hotels appear to be doing very good in terms of cleanliness and more hotels are getting on board and putting effort in cleaning practices according to msnbc reports best western hotel for example has launched a cleaning campaign that will equip housekeepers gadgets called black light testers that will be used to detect bugs that are unseen they are further offering a sanitary wrapping for the tv remote controls in their hotel the hampton inns have launched commercials featuring a hazmat suit dressed hotel guest as part of their efforts towards emphasizing cleanliness hotel guests should not really worry about getting sick but it is always good to carry some extra sanitizer hand gels or wipes for cleaning surfaces ',\n",

       " 'getty images from magazine headlines to wise words from our mother we re constantly bombarded with tips to keep our health in check but before drowning in diet soda and daily showers reassess some of these behaviors that may be doing more harm than help foods and eating habits   enhanced water a little faux fruity flavor might seem like a great way to up h o intake but flavored water like vitamin water or even smart water can be filled with sugar skip the artificially sweetened water and infuse water with actual fruit   granola and granola bars granola is made from whole grains so it can t be bad right not so fast granola and granola bars are both calorically dense and often contain a ton of sugar you may as well eat a candy bar   protein bars protein bars don t fall far from the granola bar tree they are often ultra high in calories and sugar not exactly what the body needs after a hard workout choose a healthier high protein snack instead   vitamins and supplements multiple studies have shown that taking vitamins in pill form may not have any positive effect on long term health researchers have surveyed the nonexistent or even potentially harmful ties of vitamin e and c supplements with heart disease cancer and cancer treatment plus most people get all the vitamins they need from their food and substituting pills for whole foods may mean missing out on the benefits from other compounds found in the natural sources   light beer news flash light beer doesn t necessarily mean less calories instead many simply have a lower alcohol content and for those interested in getting a buzz on the calorie difference may be negated by the need to drink more sip a healthier beer instead and split up the six pack between friends   low fat foods think twice before skipping the fat filled salmon while cutting some fat could help weight loss we may miss out on some big benefits from healthy omega   fats such as boosting brainpower and lowering the risk of heart disease   skipping meals skipping meals probably won t save us any calories in the long haul forgoing a meal may result in overeating later on so choose a healthier lunchtime treat instead   bottled water some bottled water may be filled with bacteria or chemicals when bottled in plastic containers so grab a water filter and purify tap water instead   passing on dessert don t deny your favorite dessert if really craving that double chocolate brownie enjoy a few generous bites instead of going for seconds at the dinner buffet line which could rack up even more calories    diet soda diet dr pepper may not be our friend scientists suggest too much of these zero cal beverages could do as much damage as the sugary stuff potentially leading to weight gain and an uncontrollable sweet tooth the solution skip the soda completely and opt for a healthier choice    juice diets many of us could use a few more fruits and veggies but we don t need to have spinach apple juice for breakfast lunch and dinner juice diets may leave out important nutrients and enough calories to stay strong throughout the day    microwave diet meals try making your own meals without the box and frozen plastic tray many frozen meals are packed with sodium while lacking veggies and enough calories short on time make a large batch of your favorite meal over the weekend and freeze individual portions to eat throughout the week hygiene and health    hot tubs they may be super relaxing but hot tubs are a one stop shop for bacteria and germs and may even cause a rash gross    antibacterial soap it may not be worth scrubbing down with the fancy stuff regular soap and water is just as beneficial when it comes to staying squeaky clean    brushing right after every meal just cause dessert was devoured doesn t mean we should grab the toothbrush and paste wait at least    minutes after a meal so saliva can neutralize the acid in the mouth and strengthen the enamel on those chompers    avoiding the sun while too much sun could cause a nasty burn or worse sidestepping the sun at all costs may lead to a lack of vitamin d which is essential for proper muscle and bone development    daily showers stop the scrubbing hopping in the shower too often may irritate and dry out skin if you really need to freshen up spray on some perfume or cologne and save the shower till tomorrow    catching up on sleep we re sorry to break it to you but it s pretty tricky to catch up on sleep so rather than skimping on sleep in order to cash them in later aim for a solid seven to nine hours a night    sitting up straight yeah we re surprised too sitting up straight may be bad for the back so skip the seat and try a standing desk at the office    cleaning with disinfecting products there s some evidence that certain chemicals in disinfecting products could lead to asthma simply use a regular cleaning product or detergent without the chemicals instead working out    only doing cardio hitting the roads is great and all but don t retire the weights for the running shoes make sure to strength train to burn fat lean out and look badass in the process    doing a million crunches the secret to six pack abs probably isn t crunch after crunch to flatten out and tone up the core try running some intervals lifting a few weights and cleaning up that diet instead    breathing deeply through the chest whether running the final lap or heading down the basketball court avoid deep breathing with the chest for a most effective breath to help any athlete s performance remember to use the diaphragm    static stretching pre workout when warming up static stretching aka holding positions for a certain length of time won t do much in way of preventing soreness skip the still motions and do dynamic stretches like lunges and high knees instead    lifting machines most lifting machines focus on single joint exercises which fail to improve muscle imbalance and does not burn as many calories as hitting the squat rack or swinging a kettlebell    hitting the gym daily don t get us wrong exercise is important but spending too much time at the gym leaves little time for muscles and the mind to recover make sure to get at least one or two days of rest and dominate those dumbbells the rest of the week getty images from magazine headlines to wise words from our mother

       " 'see all counterthink cartoons these days it seems increasingly difficult to know what to shop for at the grocery store is organic always better than conventional what if it s an organic product that s been flown half way around the world burning up fossil fuels that contribute to global warming how do you decide what s better a conventional apple grown locally with chemical pesticides or an organic apple from another continent this cartoon depicts a common conundrum among consumers how do you decide which grocery products are best for not just your own personal health but also the health of the planet it s a more complex decision than it might first seem for one thing much of the information necessary to make an informed decision simply isn t available to consumers there is not determined enforcement of the rule for example that foods are accurately labeled with their country of origin nor is there any requirement to disclose which foods were grown with pesticides herbicides or other chemicals banned in the united states and u k but still legal in other places like central and south america if that last sentence surprises you it should not one in a hundred american consumers is aware that it is perfectly legal for u s chemical companies to export dangerous chemical pesticides like ddt that have been banned for use on crops in the united states those pesticides are sold to countries with lower environmental and health standards which turn around and use them on crops that are exported right back to the usa so u s consumers end up eating produce grown with the very same pesticides banned in the united states and it s all perfectly legal and openly accepted by the food and drug administration and u s department of agriculture in the u s there s also the issue of so called illegal immigrants which i believe to be a strange term since in my opinion there s no such thing as an illegal human being on one hand u s consumers demand cheap produce that can only be grown and harvested with the help of illegal immigrant labor on the other hand americans grumble about too many mexicans migrating into california arizona new mexico and texas claiming they are stealing jobs and bankruptcing cities and states and yet not surprisingly when most consumers have a choice between a   apple grown on a farm that pays legal wages to u s workers and a   apple grown on a farm that pays illegal wages to an undocumented worker from mexico most americans will choose the   apple and in doing so they are in fact continuing to vote for the very illegal immigration they claim to oppose making an informed produce purchasing decision at the grocery store it turns out is nearly impossible these days there s no way to know where the food came from what soils it was grown in the immigration status of those who harvested it and which chemicals were used on it and to make matters worse powerful food corporations are constantly trying to water down the definition of organic to include the agricultural use of obscene substances such as raw human sewage fortunately that was not ultimately allowed under the organic label but the food companies tried to sneak it in the only way to truly know where your food comes from is to know your local farmers when you know the people growing your food and you can meet them face to face then you know what you re getting that s why i m a huge supporter of csas community supported agriculture farmers markets backyard gardening and local food co ops through organizations like these consumers can maintain close relationships with the people who grow their food and farmers are able to exercise far greater control over what they grow how they grow it and how much they get paid for it large commercial food companies like adm would prefer that farmers remain isolated from consumers they want all the food processing to go through them first where they set the prices and conditions that farmers are forced to accept other corporations have used intellectual property control over genetically modified seeds to threaten farmers who are refusing to adopt their pesticide ready crop varieties it s all part of a plan to control the global food supply an endeavor that inevitably destroys local farming as well as agricultural biodiversity which leaves crops susceptible to future wipeouts from infectious disease sure these companies can produce a nice round shiny apple at the grocery store for an unbelievably low price but at what cost to the world the existence of that apple is based on numerous inputs that may be highly detrimental to the health of the planet as a whole the burning of fossil fuels for farming and transportation the use of chemical pesticides that wash downstream and poison aquatic ecosystems the use of artificial fertilizers that lack real soil nutrition the destruction of microbial life in agricultural soils the loss of biodiversity and the subsequent decline in wildlife populations and so on when you look at an apple you re really looking at an historical account of everything that happened to bring you that apple the whole story is written into that apple there s the intention of the people involved with producing that apple the health of the soils the use of chemicals or not on the apple the impact on the environment and much more an organic locally farmed apple from a small family farm tells a very different story respect for nature positive intention healthful soils humility in nature connection with plants and animals biodiversity minimal use of fossil fuels and so on this is the kind of apple i d like to eat how about you now here s the real kicker in all this when you eat an apple you absorb and assimilate the story that went into creating that apple so eating an organic locally grown consciously harvested apple gives you not only nourishment and biochemical nutrition it also gives you the positive energy of abundance humility harmony and happiness a conventionally grown apple on the other hand is more likely to give you the story of greed desperation depletion fear and disease is that the energy you want circulating in your veins an apple you see is made of much more than its chemical constituents all fruits and vegetables have water and water stores emotional energy passing it on to those who consume the water since an apple is probably something like    water by volume eating an apple is actually an exercise in chewing mostly on water aren t you curious to know what kind of energy and intention is in that water you should be because beyond the vitamins minerals and phytonutrients in the apple the water impacts your body mind and spirit more than anything else and one of the reasons we see so much obesity in america today is because people are eating empty lifeless food products that provide only calories but no energetic nourishment the food is mostly an empty shell lifeless and devoid of positive vibration and then they cook it irradiate it and process it even more to give it shelf life for the most part the food isn t being grown harvested and sold at a high enough vibration to end the cravings human beings have for nourishment at all levels physical emotional and spiritual the food being sold today is missing something and if you want complete food that s nourishing at all levels i strongly recommend you grow it yourself or work with local farmers who you know are passionate about cooperating with nature to maximize abundance for themselves and those around them

       " 'one of my favorite pastimes that s not food related per se is to peruse design and crafting blogs i love design as i ve mentioned many times before but i also love anything crafty unfortunately most of the time the farthest i get is just looking at crafty things because i don t have a whole lot of free time for the task of actually executing anything this year s valentine project is a perfect case in point before anyone starts freaking out about how cute this valentine is and yes i think it s cute too it wasn t my idea i saw this  d lollipop valentine on design mom originally from the blog          two years ago i bookmarked it intending to make some with my bozos but as typically happens i ran out of time and was forced to run to the drug store and buy some valentines in a box last year it seemed that many people had caught wind of this technique because i started seeing it more and more but once again i missed the boat now with the invention of pinterest this valentine has blown up all over the place and finally i set aside the time to make some and share them here i honestly don t know what i was waiting for because one of best things about this project is that it s super easy it literally took us about a half hour to make enough for both my boy s classmates in order to put my own little twist on the idea i decided take some inspiration from the another modern craze and make mine using instagram along with a couple other iphone apps here s a what we did   take the photo i began by having my boys stand in front of a solid background with one hand outstretched into a fist while i took their picture you can use any background you d like but the less busy the better as far as what kind of camera to use you can use the camera app that comes with your phone the camera function inside of instagram itself or any other camera app of your choice you could also bag the camera phone route and take your photo using a regular digital camera i took mine using my favorite iphone camera app camera i then opened the photo with instagram to crop the photo into a square add a filter effect and a white border to the photo   add text to photo optional i could have done this in photoshop or another photo editing program like picnik which happens to be closing in april but can be used until then but i decided to keep things simple and used another iphone app i love called labelbox it s a fun and free app that lets you add retro looking labels to your photos after the text was added i uploaded the finished photo to my computer note you can skip the text part if you d like and have your child write directly on the photo using a sharpie marker   resize the photo depending on what size you d like the finished card to be you can either print out the photos as is or you can resize them and lay them out in a document to make printing out multiples easier we were giving our valentines tucked inside a goodie bag so i needed them to be relatively small to do this i used photoshop to resize the original into a       square i then created a       x    blank document and laid the small square images out onto the sheet making it possible to print    cards out at once   print trim the cards you ll need a heavier weight paper for this project as plain copy paper is too flimsy to hold a lollipop initially i used white cardstock but the photo came out a bit grainy looking which you can see in these photo here it would have been perfectly acceptable as it wasn t too bad but i decided to try a heavy matte photo paper instead and it came out much better perfectly clear and crisp i then used a paper cutter to trim the cards   punch holes in cards assemble lastly i used a single hole punch to cut holes into the top and bottom of my boy s fists we slid the lollipop sticks through the holes and voila we were done almost you could stop there or you could take it a bit further by tucking the cards inside of some super cute goodie bags like these red chevron striped ones from pretty tape we wanted to give a few more candy treats inside so these goodie bags were perfect my boys wrote their classmate s names on strips of washi tape and stuck them to the front of the bags they ve been obsessed with japanese washi tape for awhile now as have i pretty tape also has an amazing selection of tapes if you re interested they finished each bag with a hersey kiss and a dove milk chocolate heart i ve never seen them more excited about bringing valentines to school as they are tonight i hope you enjoy this little tutorial and that you and all your wee ones have a fun day tomorrow pin it a food blog with step by step cooking tutorials and acclaimed photography written by the mother of two boys food  recipes  cooking  kids  family  gardening  photography  design  products',\n",

million end of the year decade countdowns of some sort well here is            because i fricken love countdowns i have compiled my top    list of the top sports movies of the past decade which by the way don t hold a candle to the sports movies of the    s mighty ducks trilogy enough said but nontheless there have been some noteworthy films throughout the      s now whilst reading this list there are a couple things you need to keep in mind i am a    year old college senior i am not ebert and roeper jeffery lyons nor am i gene shalit i enjoy crude and sophomoric humor as well as awesomely bad films not all of the movies on my list are going to be highly regarded by the academy i will not be putting formulaic feel good sports story movies on my list the hollywood sports movie factory has mass produced some predictable corny films all throughout the      s these films include but are not limited to we are marshall the rookie gridiron gang miracle glory road radio and coach carter without further ado here is the top    best films from              the replacements      loosely based off the      nfl strike it was the story of quarterback shane falco played by the brilliant keanu reeves getting a second chance in the nfl after choking in the sugar bowl in      as a scab during a league strike he led a group of has beens and never was beens to a playoff birth in the final four games of the washington sentinals season this movie had it all the wiry foul mouthed cigarette smoking english place kicker the retard strong middle linebacker and the i m so fast but have no hands wide receiver and it even brought back disco with a jail cell gloria gaynor song and dance   the u      i may be a victim of the moment on this one but this espn    for    documentary about the university of miami football program was very entertaining this stylish film documented the program and chronicled how they went from giving away free tickets to their games at burger king to winning four national championships with three different coaches in a decade all while stealing car stereos and selling cocaine impressive   remember the titans      now i know i said i wouldn t put feel good formula movies on this list but i will give this movie some credit they were the pioneers of this and were what all of the other factory movies modeled themselves after denzel washington was great and everyone secretly knew hayden panettiere was going to be a stone cold fox and if you were to tell me you have never yelled strong side left side to your buddy on the football field then i will call you a liar   ali      the self titled biopic was in my estimation will smith s best performance no disrespect to the fresh prince it covered muhammad ali s boxing career from           the only part people really care about from his battles with liston and frasier his conversion to islam and the rumble in the jungle with the grill man himself plus the movie gave us every high school s senior graduation song for that year from r kelly pre pissing on kids   bring it on      hey mickey this movie finally shed some light on the cut throat world of competitive cheer and really made us all aware of the years of pain and suffering the inner city squads have had to go through from getting their cheers stolen by the kirsten dunst but i feel like we all learned something pretty valuable from bring it on never hire sparky polastri to teach you spirit fingers           directed by yankees die hard billy crystal the movie chronicled the      season where roger maris and mickey mantle were trying to break the babe s single season home run record they both felt the immense pressure from the race with maris losing his hair and mantle shutting it down at the end of the season with a gaping infection on his leg as we all know maris got to    but i would still rather party with mantle   dodgeball a true underdog story      dodgeball took the popular gym class sport that is all about violence exclusion and degradation and brought it to the silver screen for the first time patches o houlihan taught us the five d s of dodgeball ben stiller and vince vaughn gave us quintessential performances all while trying to figure out who steve the pirate was this movie will go down as one of the best sports comedies of all time thank you chuck norris   million dollar baby      clint eastwood directed and starred in this academy award winner as a down and out trainer trying to bring an amateur female boxer hilary swank to the top it was tough to tell who was more badass eastwood as his usual grizzled take no shit self or swank straight knocking bitches out and the narration was done by you guessed it morgan freeman that s who i would want to narrate my life story i would give this movie a higher rating but at the end of the day it s still women s boxing which until that movie came out i was unaware was a real sport   talladega nights the ballad of ricky bobby      the best movie about nascar sorry tom cruise and possibly will ferrell s funniest the movie was pitched to the studio with six simple words will ferrell as a nascar driver you ve got to love a movie that makes fun of its core demographic and they still love it i could easily have a conversation using solely ricky bobby movie quotes so thank you six pound eight ounce sweet baby jesus for letting this movie be made   friday night lights      this is in my top five sports movies of all time the story of the      season of the permian panthers in the west texas town of odessa friday night lights is the antithesis of all the sports movies i hate see above it s a drama about how f ing nuts people are about their football in west texas and the pressures the players and coaches have to go through though it was based off a true story i liked how the team lost the championship game it was completely un cliche but does this movie make me want to move to west texas and become an obsessive high

       " 'once upon a time i made three cakes in one night three    of which was fed to my ever so voracious garbage disposal it was traumatic i had been dreaming of lemon cake for weeks weeks lemon layers lemon curd and some fluffy cloud frosting that s all not that huge of a request right wrong i had a promising recipe for a two layer cake but i had been dreaming of three you can just spread out the batter into three pans right they ll just be uber thin wrong they ll be crunchy and ew when you ve got sketchy cake layers take my advice and stop right there don t try and stack them with too thin but really good lemon curd and don t make last minute cream cheese frosting instead of meringue just don t do it it s really a poor choice all around it tastes good yes but it s a soupy flop hot mess mush cake lemon thing no one really wants one of those if you re anything like me it ll be close to midnight when you assemble your disaster you might eat a decent amount of it out of shame and then sit on the kitchen floor and cry through your tears you will then decide that it s a great time to start making a redeem yourself lemon poppy seed bundt cake when you realize you re one and a half egg yolks short and don t have authentic buttermilk stop don t make it anyways go to sleep and make it in the morning don t use extra egg whites and butter instead of the missing yolks don t take it out of the oven before it s done and above all do not let your impatience get the best of you and take it out of the pan while it s still hot it will come half out of the pan and taste feel like spongy supermaket angel sponge food cake and by then it will be two in the morning your feet will hurt and your tearstained cheeks will be covered in abstract drippy eyeliner art apparently the whole third time s a charm deal is pretty valid when you ve passed the two failed cakes mark it s about time to make some cupcakes cupcakes are invincible these are a bit on the laborious side of things but they re worth every mix and scoop and fill and toast they re filled with my favorite ever lemon curd and topped with the meringue of your dreams these are time to make amends cupcakes they re sorry i forgot to pack your lunch cupcakes they re look at my fancy cupcake cupcakes adapted from martha stewart and une deux senses note in a perfect world i d make the lemon curd the night or even several days before bake fill and frost the next morning for the cake       cups all purpose flour     teaspoon baking powder     teaspoon baking soda   teaspoon salt   tablespoon lemon zest   cup   sticks unsalted butter room temperature       cups sugar   large eggs plus   large egg yolks   tablespoons fresh lemon juice   cup low fat buttermilk preheat oven to     degrees line two cupcake pans with liners in a medium bowl whisk flour baking powder baking soda salt and lemon zest in a large bowl using an electric mixer beat butter and       cups sugar until light and fluffy with mixer on low beat in eggs and yolks one at a time beat in lemon juice alternately beat in flour mixture and buttermilk beginning and ending with flour mixture mix just until combined divide batter evenly among pans filling each     full bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean       minutes let cool in pans    minutes and then cool cupcakes completely on a wire rack for the lemon curd     cup   tablespoons fresh lemon juice   tablespoons butter cubed       cup superfine sugar   eggs   egg yolks   tablespoons grated lemon zest in a heatproof bowl whisk together all ingredients except butter place it over a small pot of simmering water whisking constantly when the mixture thickens to coat the back of a spoon so that when you run your finger through it the finger stripe doesn t disappear take if off of the pot add the butter and whisk until it melts allow to cool slightly then transfer to a clean glass jar cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for the meringue   large egg white     cup of sugar     tsp cream of tartar     tsp vanilla extract for the meringue put the sugar cream of tartar and egg whites into the bowl of an electric mixer set the bowl over a pot of simmering water the bowl should not be touching the water and allow the sugar to melt into the eggs cook until the mixture has reached     degrees fahrenheit then remove the bowl from the pot of water stir in the vanilla and beat the mixture until stiff peaks form about     minutes set aside to assemble turn your oven on broil at     degrees cut a cone out of your cupcake with a small sharp knife fill the opening with a spoonful of lemon curd either cut the very top off of the cone and cover the opening or just leave it open either will work once your cupcakes are filled cover them with a generous heap of meringue use the back of a spoon to create stiff peaks in your meringue and place the cupcakes on a baking sheet place them in the oven and watch very carefully until the tops are

       " 'i ve spent way too much time this summer trying to dream up a pasta salad that wasn t boring or predictable or well you know the kind of familiar pasta salad territory you don t need me to go over for you because i love a good pasta salad i just don t find them often usually they re missing the freshness you d expect from something you eat in the summer when the markets are bursting at the seams with peak season produce often the dressing is a throw away either a too plain vinaigrette or heaps of mayonnaise lending itself to more of a mass than a salad so i knew what i didn t want i just hadn t figured out what i did not for the first time the inspiration came from a little french restaurant in our neighborhood which along with the usual deliciousness roasted chicken steak frites mussels yes please always tucks some sort of straight from the market freshness on the specials it said five bean salad but what arrived was a plate no platter of al dente shell peas and snow peas and skinny green beans and fat yellow beans and sugar snaps and cranberry beans and favas tossed in a roasted red pepper sauce with little bits of chevre tucked within it was like a plate of summer and even though i am so not the finish your plate even if you re full type the thought of letting even one fresh pea go to waste felt even more wrong and so i ate the whole thing and look at that folks i guess preggo finally has her appetite back or was emphatically craving green vegetables needless to say that dish went right into this salad though i skimped on the beans because i lack a sous chef and no pasta salad should take hours to prepare and you can get to the pasta and whatever peas or beans you have on hand and just stop there or you can continue with a vinaigrette that might be my new favorite make extra i think you ll be glad you did one year ago key lime meltawaystwo years ago mixed bean salad summer pea and roasted red pepper pasta salad this salad would also be fantastic finished with some slivered herbs like basil bits of soft goat cheese or crumbled feta or grated parmesan but really it doesn t need any of that to taste great promise   pound of small pasta i used shells because i imagined the peas would nest in there and gah such cuteness     pound snow pea pods ends trimmed    pound fresh summer peas which yielded about   cup once shelled    to   cup roasted red pepper vinaigrette recipe below bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and prepare a small ice water bath boil the snow pea pods for about two minutes or until just barely cooked but still crisp scoop them out with a large slotted spoon and drop them in the ice water bath cook the peas for about    minutes once again this will be al dente you can cook them longer if you prefer them softer scoop them out with a large slotted spoon and plunge them into the ice water bath as well drain both peas cut the snow peas into thin slivers add the pasta into the boiling water and cook it according to package instructions drain and let cool then toss in a large bowl with peas and roasted red pepper vinaigrette seasoning to taste roasted red pepper vinaigrette please don t limit your use of this to just pasta salad though i can say with absolutely no bias that it is awesome in it but that s no reason not to toss this with white beans for a quick bean salad or what your choice mix of greens are i like to slow roast bell peppers in the oven at     for one hour giving them a quarter turn with tongs every fifteen minutes so they get evenly blistered then letting them cool and peeling them i know it s faster to blacken them over a gas flame but the pepper never gets as supple and sweet as i want it to but hey that s just personal preference you know in case you wanted to know makes about one cup of dressing   red bell pepper roasted skinned and seeded or the equivalent from a jar drained    cup olive oil  tablespoons red wine vinegar and up to   tablespoons more if you like us like that extra bite in your dressing   tablespoon chopped shallot about   small     teaspoon saltseveral grinds of black pepper puree the red bell pepper in a food processor or blender as much as possible then add the remaining ingredients and running the machine until the dressing is silky smooth adjust the vinegar level and seasonings to taste see more pasta peas peppers photo salad do more link bookmark pin print email     comments a home cooking weblog from a tiny kitchen in new york city  the place to find all of your new favorite things to cook ',\n",

stop to pump gas into your car decide to do a good deed for yourself and throw away some random gum wrappers water bottles receipts and um the remnants of about    granola bars while you re fueling up and then proceed to throw your car key into the trash can along with everything else the trash can at the gas station only one of the dirtiest places on earth but don t worry try to think big picture this is just a blip on the radar at least that s what my husband told me yesterday when i said that i absolutely needed this purse that was on sale but i feel like i shouldn t buy it and did he think i should buy it and he goes uh you already have that purse in a different color and i mentally curse myselft for marrying someone metrosexual well as metrosexual as you can get with cutting all the sleeves off your nascar t shirts but still i responded that duh i waaaaas thinking big picture like dreaming about how cute this purse would look in july and august which is sooo far away and even how next year it will still be in style and didn t he know that this is majorly big picture thinking i guess that s not what he had in mind hmmpf too bad we made the best move ever post marriage which included never combining our bank accounts and remaining independent worst move ever not living together before can you say drop down drag out fights these cupcakes are big picture cupcakes though they are one of those cupcakes that you remember one that you crave one that becomes a staple especially when you can make    of them and keep them in your freezer and then eat one with extra peanut butter chocolate ganache for dinner but really my dinner last night was sourdough pretzels dipped in crazy feta with a side of peanut butter chocolate ganache but who cares it s no secret that i loath all things coffee uh hello dirty water except for coffee ice cream it became my mission in life to make all coffee like drinks taste identical to coffee ice cream which has been fabulous and horrible all rolled into one because then i can t stop consuming them and i feel like i m on speed and i talk a lot i like to think that i inherited my coffee ice cream fascination from my grandparents who always had a half gallon in their freezer unlike me though they were able to consume it in normal sized portions like a little cup here and a little taste there not like a large spoon before breakfast and a soup bowl s worth for dessert then cold stone appeared and they flaunted this creation called mud pie mojo in my face complete with coffee ice cream fudge oreos and peanut butter mashed into one i mean they practically forced it down my throat for die hard coffee fans the combination may sound heinous but it truly just works and that s how we ended up here obviously these cupcakes take a bit more work than boring regular mini cakes you need the time and patience for a few easy steps as well as the space in your freezer to store these little chunks o love but i promise they are     worth it they take away all your worries of the big picture because what else do you need besides cupcakes peanut butter fudge coffee ice cream cupcakes cake recipe from these pb chocolate cupcakes makes

doctor the following list contains ten of the most famous medical miracles performed by doctors and perhaps by the patient s own will to survive these miracles consisted of a willingness on the part of doctors patients and parents to consent to medical treatment in an otherwise unbearable or fatal situation in most cases the miracles seem most obvious on the front end when patients survive or have overcome odds against living a normal life in all cases however the patients plights and the medical remedies have altered those patients lives forever only time will tell if these patients continue to live a healthy if not totally normal life survives orthopedic decapitation doctors gave nine year old jordan taylor a one percent chance of survival after his skull was lifted from his vertebrae in an automobile accident dr richard roberts connected jordan s head with metal plates screws and rods and three months later jordan returned to school he can walk and talk this is a medical miracle considering the extent of his injuries survived without heart for     days fourteen year old d zhana simmons needed a new heart but the wait was longer than her current heart could bear doctors including dr si pham removed her heart and kept her alive for four months with two heart transplants that involved heart pumps during that time d zhana said she felt like a fake person but is grateful for her new heart and for the ability to keep her alive during the waiting process stabbed in head and survived michael hill now holds the guinness world book of records title for largest

was chained to a bed for years as he developed skills to build up his arm muscles recently doctors at the china rehabilitation research centre in beijing learned about peng s plight and devised a way

now it s so much easier to just slip on a pair of jeans and they re comfortable i have news for you ladies dresses are way easier to slip on and they re ten times more comfortable so save it for the judge how can one go through life without a pair of jeans on her stems simple rhiannon picks and chooses statement dresses instead how many times have you found yourself stumbling into your trusty jeans and then rummaging through your closet for a good    minutes pillaging for a decent top to complete your outfit only to find that you re going to be late to chem lab every day right i know i ve been there there s an easy way to fix that wear a dress it s an entire outfit in one piece boom    minutes early to class and you can chat up the cute guy who sits in front of you i ll level with you you don t have to forgo your jeans forever i m just trying to give you options and save you    minutes of pulling your hair out the bottom line is dresses are an easy way to save time when you re in a rush pop one on and viol  outfit complete and you re out the door   baby it s cold outsidesummer is over and it s way too cold to wear dresses right oh you don t know how wrong you are my friend you don t have to abandon your dresses just because the sky is cloudy dresses are the ultimate layering staple and are a snap to transition into fall with do you have cold feet just do what rhiannon does

from skirts and i can see why they dress up your outfit instantly and revive you from skinny jean drudgery how can you mimic rhiannon s skirt style look for skirts with interesting colors or patterns like florals checkers or pleats yes the black secretary skirt with the tucked in blouse is nice but it s just been done too many times now you should make a statement not blend in instead try tucking a simple blouse into your red checkered skirt and throwing on the ever versatile cardigan you ll look sophisticated and be comfortable one thing i do recommend when wearing a skirt is to keep things balanced think of it like this your body is turned upside down instead of your top being the focal point of your outfit your bottom should be especially if you have a floral or some other type of print one last tip i have to recommend with skirts is to belt it skinny or thick belts add interest to your outfit and sometimes are the finishing touch you need to pull it together still want more

lewiswhile rhiannon s clothes are mostly pulled from vintage or thrift stores i know that most of us college girls don t have the time to go scouring for clothes because of this i pulled things from all over the interweb instead i do recommend trying out thrifting though it s the best way to save money and look cute plus you ll have one of a kind pieces for today s blogger inspired wardrobe i pulled together a bevy of neutral tones and paired them with cools and brights to start off i wrangled up a cute empire waisted dress from modcloth then i chose a mustard yellow cardigan for you to throw on oh so casually when it gets nippy still cold if that s the case to battle those blustering winds of december i chose a chic ruffled overcoat to layer right on top and to give you an ounce of refinement i picked a little golden bow necklace and some brown chunky heeled booties to add some interest to your outfit and keeps things cute and whimsical i like to think that rhiannon would approve thoughts i remember discovering rhiannon s blog way back in my junior year of high school boy time flies after a couple visits to her blog she quickly became one of my daily reads while i know that her style isn t for everyone i can t help but admire her for her one of a kind point of view she pulls things from her closet so effortlessly yet always looks so put together i can t help but admire her for it so what do you guys think did i convince you to leave the skinny jeans in the closet once in a while or are you gonna keep on keeping on do you like rhiannon s style or is it too old

describe as a blend of two or more words breakfast lunch into a new word some have suggested that the term was coined in britain in      to describe a sunday meal for saturday night carousers while others suggest it was an early   th century new york reporter allegedly speaking of the typical mid day eating habits of a newspaper reporter in my midwestern upbringing brunch was done on sundays it

dependent on drugs and alcohol with the growing awareness of alternative medicines for healing the body and the development of various kinds of weight loss diets the term is used for any cleansing diet that helps in detoxifying the body a body cleansing diet is done over a short term and involves a change in eating and drinking habits in an attempt to detoxify the body by getting rid of toxins or other contaminants a popular side effect or benefit is weight loss but many people claim an improvement in overall health the most common benefits being increased energy improved immune system and resistance to disease improved mental clarity and better digestion why do a detox diet few of us have systems that are well balanced because of the lifestyles we live we don t eat healthy food and we dont get enough rest or exercise so our bodies dont function as smoothly as they should we are exposed daily to pollutants and toxins some from our environment and others are internal toxins produced as the byproduct of our digestive and metabolic processes toxic and unwanted inorgranic chemicals are found in our foods water and air in the form of fertilizers pesticides heavy metals and other pollutants at home and at work we are exposed to all sorts of airborne micro organisms and debris paint and carpet fumes everything from plastic containers to dry cleaned clothes to skin and haircare products and cosmetics bombard our bodies with unwanted pollutants all of these fall in the category of environmental toxins our bodies also produce toxins through normal digestion and metabolism if your body has the proper nutrition in sufficient quantities to provide a healthy biochemistry and if the organs of elimination and detoxification are functioning at optimal levels your body is able to naturally eliminate these toxins safely and efficiently through cellular processes via the main organs of detoxification skin bowels liver kidneys and lungs this manifests as elimination through perspiration bowel elimination urination and respiration however if the body is producing and taking in more toxins than it can safely eliminate a state of chronic toxicity may occur cleansing diets

       " 'i made my first batch of brownies from scratch a few months ago the peanut butter nutella brownies were delicious but not quite what i usually want in a brownie i like my brownies dark rich and full of chocolate flavor without being overwhelmed by sugary sweetness these sinfully dark chocolate brownies came together somewhat by accident i had it in my head for over a week that i wanted to make some brownies and the recipe for king arthur s flour fudge brownies kept coming up over and over again with rave reviews the day before i was ready to make the brownies i picked up some     dark cocoa on a whim what some people buy shoes or purses i buy chocolate some of the reviews for the original recipe complained of over sweetness so knowing that i don t like overly sweet brownies i decided to use the extra dark cocoa and cut back the sugar in my version the resulting brownies are irresistible they are fudgy and cakey super moist and deeply chocolate with that beautiful crackly crust essential in a good brownie these brownies are rich satisfying and calorie laden basically exactly what i look for in a good brownie printable recipeadapted from king arthur s flourmakes      brownies in an     pan these brownies are very dark in flavor and in color so may not be best suited for people who like sweeter brownies like kids take note this recipe is a little bit unusual in that it adds the flour to the other ingredients last but don t worry if you stir in the flour earlier by accident like i did they will still come out ok and as tempting as it will be to eat them straight out of the oven let the brownies cool before removing them from the pan they are very moist and tender and will hold together better once cool ingredients   cup   stick unsalted butter  heaping a little more than cup sugar  large eggsscant a little less than     cups     dark cocoa i used hershey s special dark   teaspoon salt  teaspoon baking powder  tablespoon vanilla extract  cup all purpose flour     ounces of dark       chocolate chopped or about   cup dark chocolate chips directions preheat the oven to     f lightly grease a   x   pan melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat or in the microwave then remove from heat add the sugar and stir to combine return the butter mixture to the heat or microwave briefly just until it s hot but not bubbling it will get shiney as you stir it according to king arthur s flour this step will dissolve more of the sugar creating the crackly shiny crust on top of your brownies in a smaller bowl crack   eggs and beat them with the cocoa salt baking powder and vanilla till smooth stir the hot butter mixture into the egg mixture until smooth stir in the flour and chocolate chunks or chips until just combined note if you want the chips to remain intact in the baked brownies rather than melting in let the batter cool in the bowl for about    minutes before stirring in the chips pour the batter into a lightly greased   x   pan and bake at     f for       minutes or until a toothpick comes out mostly clean with some moist crumbs but no loose batter cool on a rack before serving like this one blogger likes this post i made my first batch of brownies from scratch a few months ago  the peanut butter   nutella brownies were delicious  but not quite what i usually want in a brownie  i like my brownies dark  ri   ',\n",

       " 'did you know that the food industry has created different kinds of salt to fit their specific products story highlights average american eats    pounds of cheese and    pounds of sugar a year the optimum amount of sugar in a product is known as the bliss point food industry is hooked on salt author says as a miracle ingredient to solve problems expert says it s more difficult for people to control their eating habits than narcotics time com in his new book salt sugar fat pulitzer prize winning investigative reporter michael moss takes readers on a tour of the   trillion processed food industry and the sights aren t pretty the average american eats    pounds of cheese and    pounds of sugar a year and health experts say those trends triggered the obesity epidemic that has left millions at risk of heart disease diabetes and other chronic health conditions based on his interviews with top industry executives from kraft to coca cola as well as leading food scientists moss discusses how we became so dependent on processed food how does covering the food industry compare to your other investigative reporting projects in some ways the food companies are fortresses they share so little of what they do with nosy reporters at the same time i kind of discovered that food companies are in some ways are like hotels when you really start meeting the people inside who work there there are few precious secrets people really do love to talk about their work i was also incredibly fortunate to come across thousands and thousands of pages of internal documents that shed huge light on the dark corners in the processed food industry and convinced some of the key executives to talk me it s pretty widely known that sugary cereals and cheese whiz are not good for you what surprised you one of the things that really surprised me was how concerted and targeted the effort is by food companies to hit the magical formulation take sugar for example the optimum amount of sugar in a product became known as the bliss point food inventors and scientists spend a huge amount of time formulating the perfect amount of sugar that will send us over the moon and send products flying off the shelves it is the process they ve engineered that struck me as really stunning when it came to fat it was the amazing role of what the industry calls the mouth feel that s the warm gooey taste of cheese or the bite into a crisp fried chicken that you get it rushes right to the same pleasure centers of the brain that sugar does but fat is carrying twice as many calories so it is more problematic from an obesity standpoint there is almost no limit to the bliss point in fat if there is one it s up in heavy cream some place so the companies discovered they could add as much fat as they wanted to products and unless people looked closely at the nutrition facts they are going to totally love it more than they would without the fat when it comes to salt what was really staggering to me is that the industry itself is totally hooked on salt it is this miracle ingredient that solves all of their problems there is the flavor burst to the salt itself but it also serves as a preservative so foods can stay on the shelves for months it also masks a lot of the off notes in flavors that are inherent to processed foods time com why are americans still obese after all your research do you believe these foods can be considered addictive that is the one single word that the food industry hates addiction they much prefer words like crave ability and allure some of the top scientists who are very knowledgeable about addiction in the country are very convinced that for some people the most highly sugared high fat foods are every bit as addictive as some narcotics their advice to these people is don t try to eat just a couple oreo cookies because you are not going to be able to stop sugar uses the same neurological pathways as narcotic products rely on to hit the pleasure center of the brain that send out the signals eat more eat more that said the food industry defends itself by saying true narcotic addiction has certain technical thresholds that you just don t find in food addiction it s true but in some ways getting unhooked on foods is harder than getting unhooked on narcotics because you can t go cold turkey you can t just stop eating the head of the national institute on drug abuse in washington says that it s more difficult for people to control their eating habits than narcotics she is hugely empathic with overeaters in your book you talk about how the industry fiddles with the physical shapes of ingredients like fat and salt so they taste better on the tongue how are companies using this process cargill among other companies make numerous versions of salt to meet the particular needs of their customers and their products i had this vision of salt as chunks coming out of the ground and then thrown into a box but in fact they re manipulated to work perfectly with every special product there are powdered salts chunked salts salts shaped in different ways with various additives to work perfectly with processed foods all of them are geared to increase allure my favorite is the one called the kosher salt it looks like snow but is shaped like a pyramid with flat sides that enable it to stick to food better but where the magic comes in is that it s hollowed out so your saliva has more contact with the salt your saliva is what conveys the salt taste to the taste buds which send the electric signals to your brain the kosher salt also dissolves three times as fast as regular salt so you re getting a much larger hit of what the companies call the flavor burst i thought that was truly fascinating you focus heavily on the success of lunchables to appeal to kids what fascinated you about their creation lunchables was an incredible stroke of marketing genius especially when they came up with the idea of making pizza lunchables they asked mothers whether they thought their kids would eat this cold pizza that they assembled themselves and the mothers said are you kidding me that sounds so awful but when they turned to the kids and asked hey what do you guys think the kids said yeah that sounds really interesting they realized that the overwhelming attraction to the lunchables wasn t the taste it s the empowerment it s about letting kids have control and manipulate what they re eating they came up with this brilliant lunchable slogan which was all day you have to do what they say but lunch time is all yours that resonated deeply with children and sales just went through the roof the darker side of lunchables is that it brought fast food into the grocery store which has become a real concern given the obesity crisis the cdc put out a recent report saying consumption of fast food has declined from    of our calories to    there is some reason to believe that it was due to the recession because people were trying to cut back on going out to eat the question is what are they substituting for that fast food if you look at grocery stores in the last decade or more there s been an increase in foods that try and emulate fast foods it s like the industry has moved into the grocery store time com cutting soda curbs children s weight gain were you surprised by how many scientists and food company executives avoid their own products it was everything from a former top scientist at kraft saying he used to maintain his weight by jogging and then he blew out his knee and couldn t exercise his solution was to avoid sugar and all caloric drinks including all the kool aid and sugary drinks that kraft makes it ranged from him to the former top scientist at frito lay i spent days at his house going over documents relating to his efforts at frito lay to push the company to cut back on salt he served me plain cooked oatmeal and raw asparagus for lunch we toured his kitchen and he did not have one single processed food product in his cupboards or refrigerator the scientists and executives were pretty honest about their roles in creating unhealthy food did you get the impression they felt guilty about their products one reason they don t eat their own products is that they know better they know about the addictive properties of sugar salt and fat as insiders they know too much i think a lot of them have come to feel badly but not blaming themselves necessarily because the older ones invented a number of these products back in the days when dependency on them was much lower in the   s and the   s for example we were eating more home cooked meals from scratch and eating more mindfully as society evolved and we became more dependent on these conveniences these people came to see their work with real misgivings the inventor of the lunchables bob drane wishes mightily that the nutritional aspects of that product could ve been made better he is still hoping it will be made better they came to have regrets about their work in the context of the health effects their products seem to have that go hand in hand with society s increasing demand of their products you highlight some examples of companies trying to make their food healthier are there any changes you find particularly positive i was really struck by the concerted effort by kraft to embrace an anti obesity initiative at first they tried to rally the whole industry to collectively cut back and try to fight obesity including down formulating the amount of salt sugar and fats they were using but when that failed and the rest of the companies refused to join kraft set off on its own it cut back on its marketing of sugary products to children and rejiggered it s packaging so it would tell people how much salt sugar and fat in calories were in each package not just in a tiny little serving the most revolutionary thing was that they ordered their food scientists to limit the salt sugar and fat in their products this was a company where every ounce of their effort for decades and decades had gone into making products as hugely appealing and addictive as possible mind you these are not companies that want people to get fat or unhealthy that s not in their business interests but they do want people to buy as much of their products as they possibly can to have kraft then say to itself wait a minute maybe there s some other competing interest to pay attention to was mind blowing ultimately they ran into the problem that the whole industry faces which is the huge pressure from wall street and the investment community to increase profits time com the    healthiest foods of all time what do you think is the greatest obstacle standing in the way of federal regulation of salt sugar and fat i think the usda is badly conflicted it has multiple missions and one of the biggest is to support the agricultural industry this plays out most significantly in the area of cheese and beef the usda has become a partner with the dairy industry and the beef industry in promoting increased consumption of cheese and red meat at a time when its own nutritionists are encouraging people to cut back because both are heavily laden with saturated fat which is linked to heart disease this largely explains why cheese consumption has tripled in this country since the   s to as much as    pounds per person per year on the flipside the usda has this tiny little operation that creates things like the food pyramid and dietary guidelines to encourage people to limit their consumption of saturated fat but the budget for those efforts is miniscule compared to budget for promoting consumption one of the key things for moving forward is that the playing field needs to be leveled in terms of pricing we all know we should be eating more fresh vegetables and fresh fruits when you hit that part of the store and you see that blueberries cost   for a little basket and you can wheel over to the center of the store and see all these power bars and seemingly healthy things that are in fact loaded with salt sugar and fat and they are half the price or a third the price and there are all these other things that can fill up your cart for much less money that s a really difficult thing for families to deal with everyone is convinced that the government subsidies that support processed food need to be shifted over in some way to fresh fruits and vegetables or it s going to continue to be hard for even people who want to eat better to do so financially do you think there s any change in sight i think we are at a real tipping point here what i hear from people inside the food industry is that the food giants are scared to death right now the pressure from wall street on profits has never been greater the pressure from consumers for better healthier products has never been greater the pressure from the white house to do something to fight obesity is increasing the other problem they re having is that they ve cut way back on the pure science and research that they used to do and so many of the scientists i ve talked to are pleading with these companies to start putting more money into inventing new products that both taste good and are healthy i think that will be key to getting out of this mess we are in have any of your eating and purchasing habits changed since writing this i have two boys age   and    and it certainly makes things difficult my wife like so many people works outside the home like i do and our mornings are totally crazy that said we ve been working on breakfast we get the boys to eat     whole wheat toast and they really don t notice the difference between white bread and wheat we arbitrarily set a limit on cereals of  g of sugar per serving which they find kind of fun because they can go into the cereal aisles and hunt for cereals that have that much sugar or less they may have to reach low or reach high to find them because they re not at eye level but basic cherrios have one gram per serving which is fantastic and they love it if you engage kids in the process of getting healthier they rise to the occasion they are smart and they re eager time com make over your diet in one week do you have any advice for people going into the grocery store who want to eat healthier make a list and stick to it some of the plotting done by grocery stores and food manufacturers is to get you into situations where you are making spontaneous decisions that s when the soda and the sugary foods around the check counter get sold most heavily spend more time on the ends of the supermarket near the fresh vegetable and fresh fruit aisle and look for things that are affordable when you get into the center aisle be careful in the middle part because that s the highest selling area and where they put the most heavily laden salt and sugary products also look first at the front of the packaging that s where they hit you with things like low fat and low sugar and added calcium and vitamin this and vitamin that take those as warning signs when they say low fat it s often loaded with sugar to make up for the reduction in fat or likewise low salt is often loaded with sugar and fat to make up for the low salt when they splash the phrase added calcium on the front that s often a signal that the thing is loaded in all three of the pillars lastly spend some time with the nutrition facts box it has to be on every package now it can be really revealing as to what exactly is in the package pay attention to the number of servings per container because the companies know that people will typically eat a package of cookies that has three servings in it all at once you have to do the math yourself because they will list the nutrient content based on one serving which will dramatically understate the amount of nutrient load you re getting by eating the package very few of us can avoid processed foods all together our lives will not allow it i m certainly in that category but ultimately we are the ones who decide what to buy what to eat and how much to eat and that s a very powerful thing when we walk into the grocery store i hope the book can help people to understand everything the food giants are throwing at you in terms of formulating marketing and advertising i think you come away feeling more empowered to take control of that decision making process yourself this story was originally published on time com salt sugar fat q a with author michael moss copy      time inc

       " 'i ve never met anyone who didn t like pizza this economic migrant from impoverished naples is the epitome of the american dream popularised by the italian community adapted to suit new world tastes and then exported around the world it s the ultimate immigrant success story of course italians can t take all the credit for what is quite simply the world s best snack as the oxford companion to food points out the linguistic link between pizza and pitta is surely no coincidence topped breads have been popular around the mediterranean since classical times and etruscans were baking schiacciata in the tuscan region over       years ago the modern conception of pizza however is largely based on the neapolitan version not as crisp as the roman variety the base should be soft and pliable yet charred and chewy around the edge far from the embarrassment of toppings loaded on to the deep dish pizza pies of chicago the true neapolitan pizza has the mere whisper of a garnish to set off its freshly baked charms the city s famous da michele pizzeria opened in      with just one thing on the menu marinara tomatoes garlic and herbs after queen margherita visited the region    years later it grudgingly expanded its offering to include the new trend tomatoes mozzarella and basil and so it remains today the only nod to modern excess is a doppio mozzarella pizza as the american food writer jeffrey steingarten discovered in his quest for the perfect version is a creature of the heat the associazione vera pizza napoletana pdf insists that to earn its seal of approval they must be baked on the floor of a wood fired oven at     c sadly most of us don t have one of these knocking around in a corner of the kitchen so i m going to be working within the necessary limitations of the average home cook on the basis that although the results will never be as good as the pizzas at da michele s they will almost certainly be far better than a pizza bought chilled at the supermarket or which has spent    minutes steaming gently in a box on the back of a scooter giorgio locatelli explains in made in italy that pizza has to have the perfect balance between a thin crisp base and a softer garnish which is why you have to eat it within     minutes of it coming out of the oven or it will be soggy and spoilt this he says is why in italy pizza comes from the bakers or street vendors not even if they threatened you with six years in prison would you eat a takeaway pizza delivered on a motorbike case closed the language of floursthe associazione vera pizza napoletana hereafter to be known as avpn is typically strict on this point specifying finely milled    flour although what it doesn t point out assuming possibly that anyone even pretending to authenticity would know is that it comes in different strengths pizza flour as its sometimes known in italy is    with a higher gluten content than that used for pastry and so on silver spoon recipe pizza photograph felicity cloake this is worth knowing although not if you re using the recipe from italian cookery bible the silver spoon which calls for plain flour preferably italian type    suggesting the milling rather than the strength is what informs that preference the dough is tacky and difficult to handle but the finished result is good chewy crunchy on the underside and with a pleasant flavour the pizzette recipe in locatelli s made in italy meanwhile opts for strong white bread flour in his restaurants he says they use italian extra strong w    p l      but this isn t readily available outside its homeland as he observes the dough is very soft and sticky to the extent that i find his folding technique difficult and once baked the pizza is although tasty rather tough there s no meltingly soft middle here river cottage recipe pizza photograph felicity cloake river cottage baker daniel stevens uses an equal mix of strong and plain white flour in an echo of locatelli s suggested alternative of    and strong bread flour it s quite fluffy even when i defy instructions and roll it out thinner than the  mm specified but definitely softer in texture than my previous efforts river cafe recipe pizza photograph felicity cloake the river cafe classic italian cookbook goes out on a limb with a recipe borrowed from california s chez panisse which uses a rye flour sponge left to ferment for about half an hour before being combined with a strong flour dough this one seems distinctly bready and heavy to me and the rye gives it an unwelcome wholesome flavour it sticks out like a sore thumb this is pizza california hippy style jamie oliver suggests a mix of strong flour and semolina the latter apparently gives the dough an authentic flavour and texture mine turns out a bit like a cracker however undoubtedly tasty as a snack food but not terribly neapolitan heston blumenthal on his own quest for perfection plumps for     pizza flour aka strong    and makes a small batch of dough the day before which due to the longer fermentation time has had time to really develop flavour adding this to the mix certainly gives the base a more assertive slightly tangy character it has a good texture too chewy around the edge distinctly more yielding in the centre i decide that as i m after a soft base with a slight crunch to it strong    flour is the way to go and i ll keep jamie s semolina to dust the base with to add a bit of interest to the texture a state of ferment jamie oliver recipe pizza photograph felicity cloake jamie s recipe is the quickest of the lot the dough rests for a mere    minutes before dividing and rolling and i wonder if this could be to blame for its failure to rise and slightly anodyne flavour as far as i can tell the longer the ferment the more complex the flavour of the base i m not looking for something that s going to compete with the topping but as it s the principal element of the dish it should be able to stand alone if necessary with perhaps just a little olive oil and salt twenty four hours seems a little excessive although it won t harm the finished product and after a little experimentation with a batch of dough i decide four hours is sufficient to send my bases out in the world with a robust flavour and enough rise to ensure a beautifully light crust sourdough pizzas as practiced by brixton s franco manca are trendy right now and with good reason the flavours are superb but i m given to understand that not everyone has a starter hanging around in their fridge other ingredients locatelli recipe pizza i said the dough was hard to work with photograph felicity cloake the avpn permits only four ingredients in neapolitan pizza dough water salt yeast and flour in fact it goes as far as to specifically outlaw all types of fat locatelli adds extra virgin olive oil and the river cafe use milk as well i find these make the dough too soft to work with however pizza dough ought to be elastic enough to stretch under its own weight given that s how the professionals shape it but the made in italy one is seriously hard to handle i decide to save the oil for the topping instead in theory the dough should have enough flavour without it heston adds malt syrup to his dough which stumps me until i discover that this is quite common in italy it simply helps the crust to brown and sugar is often substituted if malt is unavailable i find it in a health food shop but given my limited skills as a pizzaiolo the pizza s aesthetic appearance is the least of my worries so i leave this out too in line with the avpn s principles if not their recipe i m trying my hardest to keep things simple hot hot heat heston s inverted frying pan pizza stone replacement technique photograph felicity cloake as previously mentioned the insurmountable hurdle faced by the home baker is their oven they simply aren t hot enough however there are things you can do to help it out to mimic the floor of a wood oven heston preheats an empty pan and then slides the pizza on to the red hot base before putting it under the grill i burn myself twice while attempting this and although there s more authentic charring on the sides i find it s all too easy to overcook the top while waiting for the base to harden with this technique better i think is a pizza stone or and more cheaply a terracotta saucer heated in the oven which must i m afraid go on about an hour before you want to cook turned as high as it will go the ingredients for pizza may be cheap but the fuel sadly isn t i ve also heard good things about pizzas cooked on the floor of agas but tickled as i am by the concept of a neapolitan peasant dish coming out of a rural british stove i can t vouch for this personally it s important to add the toppings as soon as possible before cooking so they don t make the dough soggy especially if you re using mozzarella and to slide the pizza as quickly as you can on to the hot surface which is another reason why dusting the bottom with semolina makes sense then all you can do is wait and pray and get ready with the plates perfect pizza felicity s perfect pizza photograph felicity cloake pizza is well worth

       " 'if we weren t all using     s technology to conduct financial transactions maybe we wouldn t get heisted debit card swipe dan nosowitz yesterday federal prosecutors in brooklyn revealed that an international team of thieves had stolen close to    million in the biggest atm fraud case in history the heist required some hacking and a lot of orchestration so news organizations and police forces have been calling it high tech and sophisticated which it isn t really it s possible because the us yes specifically the us is wildly behind the times in terms of transactional security relying on a    year old technology how did they do it hackers first broke into the system of a company in india that handles pre paid debit cards kind of like gift cards they raised or eliminated the withdrawal limit on those cards usually just a few hundred dollars and jotted down the identifying data for these new illicit cards to be the heist until this point was all digital a theft of modifying and stealing information rather than actual money the money part came thanks to the decades old magnetic strip technology the thieves evidently had a magnetic card reader writer the same kind hotels use to imprint code on magnetic room keys using any card with a magnetic strip old credit cards hotel keys hell you could use a driver s license though you wouldn t want to use your own they imprinted this new data now that old credit card is activated carrying an invented code that will tell an atm that it can withdraw a basically unlimited amount of money the thieves shipped these new cards out all over the world dozens probably hundreds of associates on cue hit atms all over manhattan and in two dozen other countries old cards masquerading as high level gift cards withdrew money the cash was used to buy expensive items rolexes cars for laundering purposes the best part those original hackers could see exactly how much each of their invented codes was withdrawing none of the associates could skim the prosecutor compared it to the movie ocean s    but really it was closer to ocean s    a movie in which the thieves took down a casino s security system and rigged every game on the floor leading to a manic blitz how is this possible well the magnetic stripe card was invented by ibm in      magnetic stripe cards work by changing the magnetism of tiny iron based particles kind of like a woolly willy they can be wiped and reset by cheap reader writers which you can buy for about     bucks typically magnetic stripe pre paid cards come with pin numbers but that doesn t provide any security at all when the thief is the one creating the card and the pin which is what happened with this heist pretty much every other developed country got rid of magnetic stripe cards years ago and many countries are multiple generations beyond that tech in the uk and much of europe the chip and pin card properly called the emv for europay mastercard and visa is dominant it s a regular plastic card but it s embedded with a tiny computer chip that serves as authentication in conjunction with a regular four digit pin the emv system is much more secure than the magnetic stripe card when it was introduced to france the country saw an    reduction in card fraud it was introduced in      by the way the france of    years ago was more advanced than the us is now the benefits authentication is far more sophisticated than reading a simple magnetized strip it incorporates actual encryption protocols like des the data encryption standard the chief vulnerability of the emv system it still has magnetic stripes emv cards have a magnetic stripe so they can be used in dumber slower countries like the us which can t read the chips the only real hack of the emv system relies on transferring information from the magnetic stripe rather than the chip japan s current standard is felica made by sony it s an rfid chip so it s contactless and benefits from some even more advanced security sony announced that the next generation felica standard would use aes or the advanced encryption standard what about the future hell not even the future right now digital wallets are taking off in other countries osaifu keitai in japan embeds felica into phones from japanese wireless carrier ntt docomo it d be like your verizon phone had all your visa info that system uses near field communication or nfc to trigger transactions tap your phone on a point of sale device enter a pin and your money s transferred nfc isn t even new modern android phones and many windows phones have it right now so why is the us so far behind infrastructure is a major factor countries like japan and the uk are much smaller so replacing all the old point of sale machines and atms is easier another problem is that american banks don t really care enough to invest in new infrastructure and the us government has an awful lot of trouble making the banks do anything they d rather not do lots of modern heists rely on old school methods the amazing computer hacker thief isn t really the norm the world s most successful jewel heist ring the pink panthers are smash and grab artists and this card fraud does require hacking but it couldn t happen if the us transaction system didn t rely on a decades old authentication system that can be negated with something you buy from amazon yesterday

the other hand eat apple slices and carrot sticks and cubes of cheese and triscuits and they re totally blissfully happy i enjoy being a girl meat boys like meat this is one of the things i make on the show it s one of marlboro man s favorite things in the entire world here s the step by step recipe yummy steak bites printable recipe below to go with the steak i make these perfect sunny side up eggs they re so easy to make and are almost artificial looking once you re finished with them think the display case at denny s or ihop here s the benefit to this sunny side up method with true sunny side up eggs you crack an egg into a skillet and let it cook until the underside is done however because the top of the egg never touches the heat at all the whites can be on the slimy side and the yolks can be way too runny and cool some people like eggs like this rocky balboa for example but i don t happen to be one of them one method for remedying this involves steaming the eggs by sticking the lid on the skillet while the eggs are cooking but i like this method better probably because it involves fat i m sorry i have to be me important you need a nonstick skillet i ve tried this method with regular skillets and it just never works for me add a small amount of canola oil to the skillet not enough to have much depth to it at all note you can also use butter or bacon grease if you re into those sorts of things but those bring along some particles and some color and you won t wind up with as pristine an egg not that that really matters in the grand scheme of human history but i thought i d mention it heat the canola oil over medium heat you don t want it too too hot as you re going to cook the eggs pretty slowly you don t want the oil so hot that the egg sizzles and turns white the second you crack it in the whites should remain clear for several seconds before they start to turn white sorry to be bossy i ve had lots of trial and error with this one and i want to save you the emotional pain oh and one other thing i snapped some of these very photos as i was filming the segment for the tv show a few of them were taken weeks earlier so i missed photographing some steps along the way i blame my nervousness in front of the camera my preoccupation with my hair and my third grade teacher so here s what you do   once the oil is mildly hot crack in an egg note three is about as many as i can tend to at a time the oil should not cover the whites if anything it should just come over the edges a tiny bit   once the eggs begin to turn white use a small spoon to carefully spoon the hot oil over the whites only go from egg to egg spooning the oil over the whites this will help the whites cook slowly so that they won t be slimy important don t spoon any oil over the yolks yet   after a minute or two touch the whites of one of the eggs and make sure they re set not jiggly and loose at that time you can spoon oil over the yolks to help them set on the surface note the reason you need to wait before spooning hot oil over the yolks is that immediately after cracking the eggs into the pan there is still egg white covering the yolk if you were to spoon the hot oil over the yolk immediately it would cause the white on the yolk to turn white which will result in the yolk having a cloudy covering like the yolk in these two photos and that s a tragic thing on the other hand if you wait the egg will settle into the skillet and the whites will sheet over the sides of the yolk and eventually leave mostly yolk there so a minute or two into the process if you spoon the hot oil over the yolk you won t get that cloudy appearance to repeat the two photos above are a cautionary tale i m exhausted   continue spooning the oil over the egg until it appears to be as done as you d like you can gauge it by lightly jiggling it or poking it with the spoon   remove the eggs from the pan with a slotted spatula then this is important drain them briefly on a paper towel before serving i fold a paper towel and hold it in my left hand then place the egg on the towel with my right hand then i just slide it onto the plate you can also just keep the egg on the spatula and pat the bottom of the spatula on the paper towel to try to get most of the oil off the egg and that s it this is a neato method guys once i learned it and practiced a bit i had some fun with it it s particularly fun if you re cooking for guests and you want your breakfast dish to look really yummy and inviting it s also great for foodbloggers or food stylists who need picture perfect eggs but it s also a lot of fun for kids because the eggs stay bright yellow and white and look like well like fake eggs which kids get a kick out of the only thing you really need to keep an eye on

       " 'november   th         comments if you promise them chocolate cake you better make sure they get it or there will be bedlam i learned first hand we ran out during one busy dinner service and there was so much uproar the kitchen transformed into an urban lord of the flies these cakes were more than just popular people traveled to have them faced with no cake they threatened to write letters to the mayor or worse the waiters eyes were black with fury for being forced to break it to the guests some diners were so filled with denial they sent their waiter back to the kitchen to make sure we were really out as though we were peddling capri pants and we simply had another size available in the back all night we argued bargained offered substitutions freebies savings bonds to no avail the people weren t pleased it was a dark day in history that i never wanted to repeat a few months later when our restaurant s mixing bowl groaned its last breath we went into a panic not seen since the barney s sample sale mind you this was not a kitchenaid sized mixing bowl it was an industrial model that occupied a vast corner of the restaurant floor and was prior to that day able to mash up a hundred pounds of dough at a time our daily agenda included mixing dozens of these signature chocolate cakes most of which would sell out over the course of the night making small batches was out of the question we d have needed to bend the laws of physics to coax more hours out of the day someone had to think quick without hesitation one of the more accomplished pastry assistants jumped to his feet ran over to the sink and started scrubbing up like a surgeon i watched him wash his entire arms from wrist to shoulder he grabbed the bowl which stood waist high next to his rather short stature and dumped beast bags of flour sugar and the usual cakey what nots into it before i could protest he plunged his tatooed limbs into the batter and started swirling his whole self around i could see through the kicked up cloud of flour dust that it was like working through quicksand so heavy and resistant but he did it and even though he looked like he delivered a calf by the end there were cake pans filled with batter all ready for baking i sure hope for your sake you didn t go to that restaurant that day certain desserts can make such an impression that they keep worming into your thoughts day in day out this is what happened to angelynn a dear reader of this blog a few weeks ago she dropped me a note describing her love for this cake and asked me to try to recreate it now i don t know about you but my fists are too tight to part with    plus shipping for a   cake so i decided to use it for inspiration only rather than dupe the flavors mine would be good in its own right and after a few tries it became a cross between the signature cake i once served and the cake angelynn was dreaming of admittedly this project is a time sucking doozy since it s based on a cake that has four separate components we ve got the the chocolate cake layers the mousse layers the milk chocolate frosting and whew finally the ganache glaze if you re feeling ambitious the whole bundle would indeed be a show stopper but allow me to suggest the following combinations for a much easier though still tantalizing result just the chocolate cake with a sprinkling of powdered sugar then served with a mound of whipped cream or ice cream the chocolate cake with just the mousse layers the chocolate cake with just the milk chocolate frosting the chocolate cake with just the chocolate glaze which can be used as a chocolate sauce when warmed or throw the cake idea overboard and enjoy just the mousse then when you re done you can lick your elbows clean by the way i scattered a little chopped peanut brittle from this entry over the top for some crunch chocolate cake   stick    g butter      cups    g sugar     cup   tablespoons   g cocoa powder  large eggs  oz   g dark chocolate melted      cups    g all purpose flour  teaspoon   g baking powder    teaspoon   g baking soda    teaspoon   gram salt    cup     ml water    cup     ml milk   gettin ready you can see how sweaty my eggs are in the photo all cold ingredients should be at room temperature for better incorporation preheat oven to     degrees f   melt the chocolate i like to chop it up fine like in the ingredients photo above and melt it in the microwave in    second intervals chocolate burns easily so stir between every zap mine took about       seconds to melt keep on the side   using a tabletop or handheld electric mixer beat the butter sugar and cocoa powder together on medium high speed until smooth creamy and fluffy about   minutes hard to see with the cocoa in the bowl but it went for about   minutes   add the eggs one at a time until each one disappears into the mix be sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl looks like a rising sun no getting liquidy here scrape the dry gritty stuff wants to collect at the bottom don t let it win   pour in the melted chocolate hopefully by now your chocolate came down in temperature a little it should feel like a warm bath if it s too hot it might melt the butter and that s no good if it s too cold it might re solidify into little bits when it hits the cold bowl so warm we want it warm so far so good chocolate added   in a medium bowl stir together the dry ingredients which include flour baking powder baking soda and salt stir em up good   combine the milk and the water and microwave them until hot about    seconds like a too hot bath   drop the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl and mix on low speed until mostly combined and then with the machine still running pour in the hot water milk mixture   be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl again the dry ingredients tend to hide there here s the finished batter    pour the batter into a parchment lined   round baking pan if you need a refresher on lining a round baking pan see the carrot cake post then bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or almost clean about    minutes let the cake cool completely even for several hours to let the crumb firm up and be less delicate when slicing i like to chill the cake in the fridge for a couple of hours so that slicing goes more smoothly next make the chocolate mousse   oz    g dark chocolate i used    el rey brand   stick    g unsalted butter  large eggs    g tablespoons sugar  tablespoons water    cup     ml heavy cream   the bits and pieces required can you spot where i blotted out the mascarpone that i didn t end up using   working with a large bowl melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave again use    second intervals and stir every time between zaps to make sure the chocolate doesn t burn set aside   whip cream to a loose peak consistency you can do this with a mixer or by hand it s not exactly liquid anymore but it s not stiff either it should just barely hold streaks i scraped this into another bowl so i could free up my kitchenaid bowl for the rest of the mousse recipe refrigerate the cream until we re ready for it   set up a double boiler fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil grab a bowl that s big enough to fit over the pot without touching the boiling water and crack in the eggs then pour in the sugar and water whisk it up and set it over the boiling water our only goal here is to warm dem eggs whisk the whole time they ll start to get frothy after a few minutes about   move the bowl off the heat and stick your finger in it yes you heard right this is to gauge the temperature don t feel like you re after some exact degree of heat it should feel like a very warm bath we are about to whip the crap out of them and warm eggs whip well if they re still cool return to top of pot if they re nice and warm pour into the kitchenaid bowl and whip on high for about   minutes if you have a hand mixer or you re whipping by hand go ahead and do it in the bowl you warmed them in the eggs will get very thick pale and creamy looking like so we ll start by pouring about     of this fluffy egg mixture into the melted chocolate bowl carefully fold it in scraping from the bottom of the bowl over to the top this will help lighten the very dense chocolate mixture so when we fold in the rest it won t deflate pour in the rest of the egg mix and fold that in then add the almost forgotten whipped cream fold again so much folding it s like laundry day here s the all folded ready mousse as an aside here s my earlier screw up my first attempt at the mousse you can see all the bits of scrambled eggs floating around gross indeed i must have let them get away from me when i was busy photographing and trying to whisk at the same time i actually thought it wasn t that bad until i folded in my chocolate and saw the truth magnified before my very eyes now we can start the assembly   line a   springform pan with parchment   peel off the paper that ended up on your cake   slice off the dome by holding a serrated knife parallel to the table and slowly sawing away dome sliced off snack on the rejected dome   now we need to slice the rest of the cake in half horizontally i think it s best to eyeball this and you will get better with practice what i like to do is find the center of the cake from top to bottom where my knife is and mentally note the distance from the top edge of the cake as shown by the arrow run the knife around the edge spinning the cake don t force the knife it will do it s job slowly as you run the knife around the cake it will cut deeper and deeper until it slices through the center as you can see by the arrow i m always looking at that halfway point to help guide the knife two mostly even slices if your slices aren t perfectly even no biggie they ll be hidden once the cake is together set one slice into the prepped springform pan pour in half the mousse and smooth it out to the edges carefully place the other cake layer on top and press it down gently pour the rest of the mousse on and smooth that out over the top as uniformly as possible freeze this on a flat shelf for at least   hours or overnight make the milk chocolate frosting take note that you have to start the frosting a few hours before you plan to frost the cake right when the cake goes into the freezer is a good time       cup     ml heavy cream  oz     g milk chocolate chopped into peas sized bits  stick     g butter    tsp   g vanilla extract    cup    g powdered sugar   things we need   bring the heavy cream to a boil and pour over the chocolate allow it to rest for a minute or two to let the heat melt the chocolate then whisk it up into a sort of loose ganache refrigerate it until it sets to a soft solid at least   hours overnight s ok too   when you re ready to frost the cake whip your butter which should be softened to room temperature and vanilla until they re very smooth and creamy     minutes scrape down the bowl   add in the set up milk chocolate ganache and powdered sugar and whip until light and fluffy     minutes i changed to a whip attachment cause it whips better who knew finished frosting now make the chocolate sauce as described in this post this sauce is firm when cold and liquid when warm so it can be used in lots of ways this cake sports it as a glaze for the top and a sauce on the plate you can make it ahead and rewarm it in the microwave at    second intervals stirring until you get the consistency you need finish the assembly   grab the cake from the freezer and run a knife around the edge to release it   carefully release the springform mechanism to free the cake   frost a large offset spatula makes the job easier i have my cake set on some parchment sheets to control the mess good enough   you can decorate in any way or leave the cake simply frosted i scooped the rest of the frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip and piped two rows of kisses if you need a refresher on filling a pastry bag see here   when the chocolate sauce is lukewarm and only when it s lukewarm stir it up and pour it over the cake to glaze the top if the sauce is too hot when you pour it will melt the frosting underneath making the top look muddled it will probably set quickly because your cake is still giving off frozeness from within so hop to it viola refrigerate this until ready to serve up to a day ahead make sure it s fully defrosted before serving happy thursday to me chocolate cake   stick    g butter      cups    g sugar

       " 'and a giveaway contest although it s been said that even a piece of plywood would taste good pan ed that s not the starting point of this recipe although veal is the more common pan ed menu item among restaurants at home i prefer to use pork loin slices or boneless skinless chicken breast meat these other cuts of meat have all the advantages of veal with none of the disadvantages including the dryness expense and the way butchers slice veal wrong which is to say they cut veal way to thick and in most cases store bought veal is really not veal at all but calf and calf is much tougher that true veal pan ed medallions of chicken pork or veal are so easily and quickly cooked that you need to get the pasta or side dish finished before starting this process for any recipe that calls for pan ed you need to know that the meats are interchangeable such as the veal with chicken or pork substituting any of the proteins will work in any case pasta bordelaise is the perfect companion to pan ed anything although pasta alfredo is more common in restaurants in this instance i served a side of steamed spinach and also mushrooms in the style of mushrooms a la grecque as you can see in the photos and i will post the recipe for this later traditionally pan ed is a term found among new orleans restaurants and typically means that the meat portion is cut into very thin slices then lightly dusted with flour dipped into an egg wash and then coated with breadcrumbs and pan saut ed in oil or butter until golden brown and cooked through you will find several recipes that call for adding a large quantity of oil to the pan and typically this means about a   inch or so of oil i find this to be way too much oil you only need enough fat to coat the bottom of the pan and usually this means only a couple of tablespoons olive oil or clarified butter in this recipe i am not cutting the chicken into thin slices just pounding it to about a   inch thickness traditional pan ed veal or pork would have the meat sliced across the grain to about one eighth to   inch thickness or less we were taught that when cutting veal for a pan e you needed to be able to see through the slice or make it almost paper thin of course this was the challenge and rarely matched thinner is better in this recipe i have used the progresso lemon pepper panko breadcrumbs product and the prize

weddings are great for planning activities after the ceremony where your guests can change up into more comfortable clothing for the rest of the day if you or a family member or close friend don t

the price or keep it really casual by simply having a backyard barbecue cheap wedding reception entertainmentif you re a regular at a local tavern or firehouse check to see if the house band or regular dj would do a backyard wedding for a small wedding at a lower cost than a larger wedding cut back on the hours that the contracted band or dj would play to save some money there wedding music is usually contracted for a minimum of four hours but it doesn t hurt to ask if you can negotiate for two or three hours instead and have all of the traditional dances and other events take place

       " 'happy new year everyone last night was the perfect wrap up to      a large group of my friends from middle school and high school got together at about  pm to catch up and sip champagne at   a fabulouusss party bus picked us up and whisked us away to the highball we bowled karaoked and imbibed with bottle service for a few hours before dancing the night away to a cake cover band and dj i was a bit nervous beforehand because i hadn t seen anyone in so long but my fears were for nothing everyone was incredibly warm and had an excited open mind for the night ahead it was lovely to catch up with old friends several of whom i hadn t seen in years it is so important to me to maintain friendships you could almost say i enjoy collecting friends but i cant help it everyone is fascinating to me i truly believe everyone has something to offer although i don t think that anyone needs to offer anything to make them a worthy friend one of my oldest bestest friends emily currently i am laying in bed with the most stereotypical quintessential hangover headache to ever exist it was pounding harder than insert hip obscure drummer that i don t know about but is finally subsiding enough to allow me to think semi clearly and write a hopefully coherent blog post in the past i haven t made new years resolutions goal making and self improvements are a constant in my mind at the very least on the back burner of my brain so resolving to make changes at the new year always seemed redundant plus it seems for many that making a new years resolution is often a safe way to make sure that goal isn t met however i am starting to see the beauty in resolving to make changes at the start of a year why not im hoping that publicizing my goals will help me accomplish them mental goals don t take things personally at times i have a problem with interpreting others words tones or actions as being a personal attack which causes me to get defensive and then snappy in response this stems both from personal insecurity and self centeredness which i hate it ain t about me if someone says something in a rude tone or asks me the same question   times it doesn t mean that they dislike me or don t care about me it means they have their own problems going on that have nothing to do with me instead of making it about me i want to try to take it for what it is and if possible help the other person with whatever they are struggling with be more patient i think that reminding myself that regarding my time as precious is selfish and false will help with this appreciate other s mental processes more every persons mind is different each and every individual has their own unique set of neural connections and pathways we think differently utilizing different forms of logic and using differing levels of emotional sense intelligent sense and gut intuition to make decisions what may seem completely illogical to me may be the right thing to do for another and i need to remember this academic goals rock the shit out of the mcat so that i can get into a med school please dear god read the news at least every other day i am pretty good about this but i do go through phases of being clueless about what is going on i feel like that is giving a big eff you to the world which i certainly don t want to do read   books a month i am completely okay with this goal not starting until after i have taken the mcat and graduated in june realistically that just ain t gonna happen blog goals post at least   recipe per week this goal would have seemed ridiculous to me in the days that i posted a recipe per day but now it seems appropriate with mcat studying school and life i think posting   or   recipes a week will be doable make someone else s recipe at least once per week real meals with leftovers and more than   ingredients this goes hand in hand with the previous goal re make some of my own recipes and perfect them now that i have a littlleee more knowledge of baking and cooking i know i can tweak some of my recipes especially older muffin recipes to make them even better i definitely have more goals to share but i want to think them through more before posting they are so grand i need to find a way to make them more manageable and tangible what are your new years goals or resolutions what would you like to see more or less of on this blog in      please share a blog of healthy and delicious meal ideas ',\n",

       " 'photo by tess by ali hale if you had to pick just two words two little words that would empower you to change your life what would they be mine would be i can you ve probably heard various personal development experts life coaches or self appointed gurus tell you not to say i can t but why exactly are those two little words i can so important what do they add up to and how do they work i am responsible for my life the first word is i for me this emphasizes who has to do the changing however much we might like to blame someone else for the bits of our life we don t like the truth is that we ve got full responsibility for our life conditions unless you re in an very extreme situation like being held prisoner there s no reason why you can t wake up one morning and decide to completely overhaul your life you can quit your job start that small business you ve always dreamt about learn to play a musical instrument take the first step in healing a broken relationship start eating more healthily be more active don t ever put your hopes for change on someone else this sort of thinking looks like it s up to my partner to get a good job then i ll be better off financially or if only my mother would cook healthier food i wouldn t be overweight no one else can change you if you re heavily in debt overspending addicted to shopping and you win the lottery will you really turn your life around or will you rapidly end up back where you started you might want to read   lottery winners who lost their millions for some food for thought here however difficult your circumstances poor health family problems money troubles you can start the process of change by looking at your response to events stephen covey author of the   habits of highly effective people emphasises that it isn t a negative event itself that s a problem it s your response to it he explains that our most difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge our character and develop the internal powers the freedom to handle difficult circumstances in the future and to inspire others to do so as well i have the ability to act it s not enough to just think i when you want to make a change in your life though simply accepting that you re responsible for your life doesn t necessarily empower you to change in fact it can be a bit depressing when you accept that the bits of your life you don t like are your responsibility rather than someone else s fault so the second word that i consider crucial for change is the word can with the tools of motivation self discipline and guidance from those more expert than us it s possible for us to accomplish anything we really set our minds to and set our hearts on how often have you said i can t or words to that effect have you ever attempted a goal that you were saying i can t about i certainly haven t here are a few popular i can t statements i can t sing write paint act i m trapped in this job relationship town situation i don t have any choices it would be impossible to quit i ll never succeed i can t lose weight i always fail think about one of your i can t statements what do you often tell yourself or others that

looking at one right now scan the image at the top of this article and it ll open a link to the mobile version of this article very meta that s a pretty typical example of a qr code occasionally useful but often pointless either way these plucky information sources are routinely ignored and usually reviled here s where the next big thing in scannable coding went so horribly wrong qr quick response code is the trademark name for the two dimensional barcode system it was originally invented in      by denso wave a toyota subsidiary as a way to track vehicles as they were assembled and to scan components at high speeds while denso wave does hold the patent on the technology it has granted free licence on it going so far as to publish the spec online and allowing anyone to use it the conventional one dimensional barcodes used on virtually every consumer product are mechanically scanned that is they re read by physically bouncing a narrow beam of light onto the code which can be interpreted using the pattern of light reflected off the white gaps between the lines qr codes on the other hand can not only hold     times more data than  d barcodes they can also be digitally scanned the block of smaller black and white squares is read by a smart phone s image sensor then interpreted by the system processor the three large squares act as alignment targets while the smaller square in the remaining corner acts to normalize the size and angle of the shot as you can see from the image on the left the blue strips near the alignment squares contain formatting information and the remaining yellow area is the actual data that s converted into binary code and checked for errors before being displayed the encoded data can be interpreted as one of four primary modes numeric alphanumeric byte binary and kanji other forms of data can also be displayed with the appropriate extensions as qr code technology evolved it began to contain more and more information the initial version was    x    pixels and held just   characters worth of data the most recent version is     pixels square and it holds      characters enough for a few pages of information qr codes have long since expanded their usefulness beyond the automotive industry they re used today in everything from inventory tracking to shipping and logistics to online ticketing fandango is a big fan bands put them on fliers to link to their videos on youtube or set reminders for upcoming shows businesses use it to put google maps directions on a business card automatically load a web page or send a text email to the company helpline one enterprising wildlife refuge in sanibel florida has installed the codes on signs along hiking trails and programmed them with information about the local fauna so with all these new and interesting ways to use this burgeoning technology which coincidentally got a boost recently when it was announced that the iphone   would not include the competing nfc system why aren t they more popular according to comscore as of december      only    percent of americans    percent of canadians and    percent of spanish and uk smartphone owners actually use qr codes at all in part it s because advertisers have attached themselves to qr like it s a golden teat the rate of qr codes in magazine ads rose by five percent last year from     to     percent according to marketing firm nellymoser you can find qr codes in stores billboards subway ads posters and magazines it s an effort to convey the appearance of being tech savvy thaddeus kromelis a strategist at wpp s wppgy blue state digital told business insider unfortunately most consumers aren t buying it advertisers are looking at every way possible that they can connect with consumers said forrester research analyst patti freeman evans consumers aren t saying oh i really want to be able to connect with companies and brands as such the primary use of qr codes last year was actually for product scanning either to recieve further information on a product or a coupon reward and was primarily done at home this is due largely to the inherent limitations that qr suffers from the system needs a steady hand to take the shot the proper qr app to interpret it and a data connection to load the webpage and content so when advertisers put qr codes on freeway billboards or on subway ads where there is little cell reception and expect users to then go through the trouble of installing an app just to be taken to the desktop version of the corporate website it s little wonder why nobody bothers with it thick headed advertisers aren t the only drawbacks to qr codes though the codes can also be used to transmit malicious code in what s known as attagging since anyone can create the codes it s easy to write a bit of malware put it in a qr code and slap that code over a legitimate tag some sap scans the bad code and if his permissions are set too loosely the code could give itself access to everything from the camera to the contacts to the gps data or it could connect to an infection site loaded with browser exploits the phone an become part of a bot net or be used to send unauthorized texts hackers in russia once used qr to commandeer phones to send   international sms messages and of course there s the open source issue great for developers but not so terrific for the end users just trying to read the things there are multitudes of qr readers in every app store and all of them offer a slightly different user experience none of the big three ios android or wp  offer a native app plus there is no dominant brand of reader so users are stuck picking qr readers essentially at random hoping for the best all that hassle to hopefully look at a company s website or possibly have

       " 'home recipes bolognese is one of the most famous dishes in italy but where outside bologna can one eat a proper rag these days right in your kitchen if you follow my recipe to most people outside italy bolognese is lowly refectoire fare most often bought from the supermarket when not eaten straight off the can but in bologna one of italy s most prestigious cities for food rag bolognese is a legendary dish that is not only part but defines the city s identity tackling such a legend would undoubtedly trigger a torrent of indignant emails from concerned bolognese readers how dare you call this rag bolognese they would say you are not from our beloved red city well i have an ace up my chef blouse one that trumps them all two legendary bologna home chefs sisters margherita and valeria simili have become the most respected authority on all things related to bolognese pasta in their book sfida al matterello a manual in italian to teach the principles of homemade pasta la sfoglia bolognese there is a whole chapter about making rag it is called his majesty the rag here is how they do it rag bolognese  tbsp butter  tbsp oil   gr     oz pancetta or parma ham or quality dried bacon    gr  lbs ground chuck beef or half beef and half pork shoulder    gr  lbs pured and skinned tomatoes passata   medium onion   medium carrot   celery stick     chicken livers     glass     cup dry white wine   glasses   cup full fat milk   glasses   cup chicken stock salt pepper pinch of nutmeg in this article i prepare twice this quantity the simili twins call for pancetta or parma ham which you need to finely dice as you ll see later i used half prosciutto and half valaisian petit lard a local flavorsome bacon prepare the aromatic garniture peel your carrot and onions and garlic clove if using trim and wash a celery stick cut the carrot lengthwise into thin slices then perpendicular to that cut to make long sticks and finally perpendicular to the two former cuts to make an orange sea of tiny carrot cubes proceed with the celery stick be thorough roughly cut cubes will show in the final product finely dicing these vegetables is a way to show respect to the recipe the produce and your guests reserve in a small bowl if you think chicken liver is best left to the dogs i won t blame you but in rag bolognese it is an essential ingredient the liver taste melts and disappears into the whole bringing a slight hit me back taste nobody will be any the wiser unless they are from bologna if you are doubtful please try with a little piece for daddy and you ll see wash carefully the livers to remove the slightest trace of the greenish bile then crush the livers under a flat knife and chop them all the ingredients prepared in their order of appearance bottom to top and left to right from the bottom left pancetta onions liver herbs carrots and celery meats butter milk wine tomato and oil on the stove my largest saucepan stick rust sensitive iron pan from the legendary burgundy restaurant greuse in tournus behind a smaller pot heats the chicken stock another one will heat the milk aspiring home chefs hear me take some time to read your recipes several times before you start you want it firmly commited to memory like a soldier who needs to field strip his gun in the heat of battle or a pilot who needs to pull a dozen controls in under   seconds in a gusty landing if you lay all your ingredients neatly and close to your stove you will not only increase your recipe s chance of success you will also make the process much more enjoyable with you celebrating the beauty of life and nature on the altar of your stove how would this liturgy look if you work from greasy papers and dirty bowls place your widest frying pan on a very hot burner and add   tbsp oil with   tbsp butter why a wide pan and why mix oil with butter we will soon saut the meat to develop its taste through browning maillard reaction if we place too much meat in too small a pan the meat will render its juices and that will prevent any browning you ll be boiling your meat in its own juice if you have a small pan or a weak flame you ll need to brown the meat in several batches there is no point in doing this unless you can get your meat to turn brown so if you d rather ignore this recommendation which comes directly from the simili twins you could ignore the meat sauting altogether whith a much less tasty end product of course we mix the butter with oil so as to increase the temperature beyond which the butter will burn add the onions and fry until the onions are soft and their water has evaporated you do not need to wait until they are brown next stop carrots and celery drop them into the onions and saut over high heat until they start to brown while this goes on prepare our next ingredients the pancetta on the picture i have italian pancetta in the front and swiss air dried petit lard in the back drop the bacon into the pan mix and saut to complete our aromatic garnish push everything on the side my pan is oval shaped and designed to let the chef tonight i am the chef keep some ingredients hot while he cooks others on the part of the pan directly over the burner if you have a small pan don t worry there is hope just remove the aromatic garnish onion carrots celery and bacon to a dish cover to keep warm and continue add the liver and turn frequently as it coagulates use a wooden paddle to break it into tiny pieces place the part of the pan that is free directly on the burner and add part of the ground meat how much should you use not more than what can cover the pan s bottom evenly you need to keep that pan hot if you put too much meat the pan s temperature will be absorbed by the cold meat and you won t manage to brown it if in doubt just use a lemon sized chunk of ground meat to start we will do this in several stages fxcuisine  fxcuisine com  fx  fxkitchen ',\n",

       " 'a guacamole grilled cheese sandwich has been on my to try list for a while now and since i was making the bacon guacamole on the weekend i figured i would just pick up double the ingredients and make both the basic idea behind this grilled cheese is quite simple and it started out with just adding guacamole to a grilled cheese but with the success of combining salty bacon y magnificence with cool and creamy guacamole i could not resist adding a few slices of bacon to the sandwich i also had some leftover corn tortilla chips from dipping on the weekend so i decided to crumble a few of them and add them to the sandwich for texture like all grilled cheese sandwiches this one is pretty easy to make though you want to try to remember to pull the guacamole out of the fridge early so that it can come up to room temperature before adding it to the sandwich having all of the ingredients of the sandwich at room temperature is going to help ensure that the cheese melts into ooey gooey goodness so pull the cheese and butter out of the fridge at the same time as the guacamole the only real problem with this guacamole grilled cheese sandwich is that it can be a bit messy to eat but i was not really thinking about that as i wolfed mine down this sandwich is certainly one amazing way to enjoy any leftover guacamole and it is even worth making a fresh batch of guacamole just to make some grilled cheese bacon guacamole grilled cheese sandwicha buttery and toasty grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with cool and creamy guacamole crispy bacon and melted jack and cheddar cheese the crunchy crumbled tortilla chips in this grilled cheese pay tribute to the classic combination of tortilla chips and guacamole dip servings makes   sandwichprep time   minutescook time    minutestotal time    minutesprintable recipeingredients  slices bacon  slices sour dough bread  tablespoon butter room temperature    cup jack and cheddar cheese shredded  tablespoons guacamole room temperature  tablespoon tortilla chips crumbled optional directionscook the bacon until crispy and set aside on paper towels to drain butter one side of each slice of bread sprinkle half of the cheese onto the unbuttered side of one slice of bread followed by the guacamole tortilla chips the remaining cheese and finally top with the remaining slice of bread with the buttered side up grill over medium heat until golden brown and the cheese has melted about     minutes per side similar recipes jalape o popper grilled cheese sandwichspinach pesto grilled cheese sandwichguacamole bltguacamole omelette with salsa ',\n",

       " 'on the twelfth day of christmas my true love gave to me cornmeal black pepper rosemary butter cookies after several weeks of nearly non stop high intensity cookie baking i present you with the final cookie of this year s twelve days of christmas cookies starry night bake a thon ta da in the kick off post i set the stage for this completely new collection of cookies most of which break rather dramatically from the traditional holiday cookies of my childhood i really wanted to push my understanding of what makes a remarkable and thus memorable christmas cookie i wanted to try new and exciting flavor and texture combinations i wanted to stretch myself as a baker as i say in the twelve days of christmas cookies starry night kick off post i wanted to throw tradition to the proverbial wind this holiday season however i did not change my basic tenets of what makes a cookie a holiday cookie many cookies perhaps most cookies do not fill this bill in my estimation here are the tenets i presented in the twelve days of christmas deck the halls kick off post a holiday cookie must be very very buttery dry light tender and or crisp rather than chewy or moist an excellent keeper must store and or freeze for   weeks small in size so you can serve and eat a variety beautiful and festive fun to make fun to eat fun to give all of this year s christmas cookies meet these requirements and several of them are so incredible that i will not be able to wait until next december to bake and eat them again the cookie you are looking at is one of those cookies the first words out of mauijim s mouth after eating this cookie and wiping the butter off his lips was you cannot share this recipe then he proceeded to eat   more cookies claiming they were defective and thus not attractive enough for the photo shoot in truth he prefers the defective ones anyway you know the cookies that are a little too brown around the edges he says he wishes i would overbrown all of the cookies even though it mars their appearance does he think those overbrowned edges on half of the cookies happen by carelessness ha when i asked him why i shouldn t share the recipe he said way too good this one goes in the vault well i agree that these cookies are some of the best i ve ever created but it s christmas and christmas is about sharing your very best i want you to taste these amazing morsels so light crisp crunchy spicy and redolent with fresh rosemary and cornmeal and i can t unfortunately bake them for you so over loud protests from the love of my life i make you this little offering from my heart to yours i hope these special cookies add a little spicy sparkle to your holiday festivities technique note to make these cookies extra easy i used my favorite no hassle shaping technique which does however require a    scoop available in kitchenware stores if you prefer to roll the dough out on a lightly floured pastry cloth using a cloth covered rolling pin and then cut them out with cookie cutters that is certainly an option cornmeal black pepper rosemary butter cookies this wonderful cookie is inspired by the cornmeal butter cookies made by italian bakers in italy and america alike i first sampled a cornmeal cookie many moons ago in a small italian bakery in san francisco as i recall the bakery featured half a dozen or more varieties of cornmeal cookies i was enthralled because the notion of adding cornmeal to cookie dough had never occurred to me this was before all the great italian baking books that widened our horizons a few years later i loved the corn flavor and the open crunchy texture immediately since then i have created many riffs on this traditional cookie but this is my new favorite    cups king arthur unbleached all purpose flour   cup

       " 'as of saturday your options for owning an unlocked phone become far more limited you can ask your carrier to unlock it and good luck with that or you can pay a premium to manufacturers like apple or google for a new unlocked phone you just can t unlock your phone yourself at least not legally that decision was made not by voters the courts or even congress it was made by one man    year old congressional librarian james hadley billington who is responsible for interpreting the meaning of the digital millennium copyright act dmca billington decided last october that unlocking your phone yourself is a violation of the act which was originally written to prevent digital piracy congressional librarian james hadley billington when billington made his decision he also granted a    day exemption period in which people could still buy phones that they could later unlock but only after asking their carrier to do it and getting no for an answer that period ends saturday after that the question of whether or not the smartphone you buy is truly your own gets a little fuzzy the idea that a decision that will affect so many and involves so much money could rest on a single unelected person is bizarre at best and absurd at worst but indeed the law reads in section      of the dmca upon the recommendation of the register of copyrights the librarian of congress may designate certain classes of works as exempt from the prohibition against circumvention of technological measures that control access to copyrighted works what s it mean to me when you unlock your phone you change part of the firmware code in such a way that makes the phone able to connect to more than one wireless provider s network you can unlock your phone by plugging it into your computer and using any of the widely available unlocking software downloads the ban means that you won t be able to lawfully decouple your phone from one carrier and move to another carrier that uses the same cellular technology gsm cdma etc unless your carrier agrees to send you an unlock code imagine buying a car equipped with software that prevents you from taking certain roads and being legally barred from disabling the software the wireless carriers will unlock phones under certain circumstances but they don t like to for instance at t will unlock your iphone if you can prove you are a current or former at t subscriber that your iphone was designed for use on the at t network and that you are in complete compliance with all contract obligations including any term commitment if you re still in contract they probably won t do it especially if its an iphone so you won t be able to unlock your phone and connect it to a compatible network overseas with an unlocked phone you can visit another country buy a compatible sim card at a store on the street and immediately get phone and web service pre paid gets harder many people now buy used iphones and other premium smartphones then sign up for low cost no contract cell service from the likes of virgin mobile straight talk and t mobile that s because in pre paid plans you have to either buy a new phone at full retail cost or buy a used one and bring your own device this approach gets you out of a costly long term relationship with a profit hungry carrier and likely saves you money every month on your phone bill it also saves you the financing charges that your carrier builds into your bill in exchange for subsidizing your phone up front but with the unlocking ban people can no longer legally quit their carrier usually after paying a penalty unlock their phone and sign up for a prepaid plan the ban may also make it much harder to find a good unlocked smartphone on the used market at a reasonable price sure you can pay a premium to apple or google for an unlocked version of one of their new phones iphone   nexus but that makes joining a pre paid plan a costly experience at the outset and at t will unlock your phone after your contract expires however by then you ve already paid the carrier the high monthly rates and phone finance charges for two years big money there s big money at stake here the ctia the association that represents the interests of the large cellular providers is first on the list to file a legal brief on the matter with the library of congress the    page document argues that the owner of the smartphone device is not necessarily the owner of the firmware running on the device and that altering the firmware is a violation of the copyright owned by the carrier the majority of the points argued by the ctia attorneys in the document seem designed to disqualify the arguments of phone unlocking proponents based on legal technicalities big carriers like at t and verizon make much more profit on post paid contract plans than they do on pre paid plans you need only look at the companies quarterly financial statements to see that the unlocking ban will simply help keep subscribers locked in post paid plans reducing churn and phone locking is the carriers main instrument for keeping people locking in two year post paid contracts the two year contract is designed so that the consumer is attracted by the offer of a subsidized handset at very low cost and then signs up for a two year service term to get it the carrier then receives a high monthly payment from the subscriber for    months that when totaled up far exceeds the real cost of the devices and services delivered during the contract period the real reason behind this ruling is that we re talking about a device that is tied to monthly recurring services says dan hays u s wireless services advisory leader at price waterhouse coopers the desire on the part of consumers to unlock their phones really effects the challenge the mobile carriers face in continuing to pursue their subscription model and the ctia says essentially that same thing in its legal filing one feature of the marketplace is the ability of carriers to subsidize handsets and to offer those handsets and their accompanying software to consumers at prices well below the prices that otherwise would need to be charged those subsidies depend on ensuring that the handset will be used as contemplated with the carrier s service but not everybody agrees that that was the intended purpose of the dmca the dmca was never meant to enforce mobile phone business models or to preserve incompatible devices more generally and the copyright office should have said so and granted a broad exemption says electronic freedom foundation digital rights analyst rebecca jeschke the truth is the decision to ban unlocking last october took place in a dark corner of washington as hays terms it tech policy decisions handed down by the courts the fcc the ftc or congress tend to get a lot of attention but who knew that a decision potentially so important to consumers would emerge from the office of the congressional librarian i d venture that the decision didn t pop up on the radars of many people in the tech industry and the media last october and is taking many by surprise now that the implications of the decision are about to become reality hays says that when lte phones become more common the issue of unlocking becomes even more important today when you unlock an at t gsm phone your only real option is to go to t mobile which uses the same cellular technology but when all carriers have converted over to the new lte networks the owner of an unlocked lte phone has a choice of four major carriers and a number of regional ones hays says the carriers may have worked hard to get an unlocking ban to protect themselves against widespread unlocking and massive churn in the lte future phones bought after january    can no longer lawfully be decoupled from a carrier by the owner of the device  how did this decision come to rest with a single non elected  non technical  elderly librarian in washington  phone

       " 'when it was cool to like alternative music i resisted i didn t like it and i thought most of the people who listened to it were weirdos but now that i m older and more mature i enjoy it and i no longer think people who like alternative music are weirdos i mean i like it how could they be weirdos so today i decided to take a look at the top    alternative songs of all time now before we get started i have to come clean first you won t see nirvana on here why they make me sick and angry i m not sure why but if they come on the radio i get angry second stay by lisa loeb didn t make the list this angers me because i love her and love that song but my doofus coworkers told me it s not alternative oh well i guess i ll leave the poor girl out by the way those glasses are hot    black hole sun soundgarden no idea what it means but it still makes me happy when it pops on the radio    til i hear it from you gin blossoms i think i liked this video because liv tyler was in it and the song grew on me enough that i loved it this was always on the box    only happy when it rains garbage another hot chick god these angry chicks were hot plus she had red hair i m not a huge fan but the depression part of the song was great    lightning crashes live hard song to sing at karaoke but what a beautiful tune i m surprised they never did anything of note after this album    insane in the membrane cypress hill i couldn t decide if this was just rap or alternative but i included it anyway they were a fantastic group i wonder what became of them    warning green day i didn t like green day s early stuff but this and minority were awesome cover bands would play this a lot about    years ago and it always made for a fun time    bittersweet symphony verve this is better as an instrumental but it s great with the words too the music sounds so happy but the guy in the video was a complete turd say excuse me    swallowed bush this wasn t the kind of song that had longevity but i used my sister s car last summer to cart her kids around and it was on her satellite radio let s just say that was an awesome ride to the water park    jeremy pearl jam i wanted to go elderly woman behind a counter in a small town because that s by far the best pearl jam song but i didn t want to be ostracized so here you go now go put your flannel on and shut up         smashing pumpkins you wonder why i didn t like alternative fans they hung with freaks and ghouls still you gotta admit this is catchy    spiderwebs no doubt gwen stefani sold out when she was singing about hollaback girls because she was phenomenal she s lucky she s still hot plus my friend wrote a great parody to this song so it will always rank right up there with me    epic faith no more i m not down with hurting a fish like they did in the video but just thinking about this song makes me want to throw things in a fit of anger that s a sure sign of a good alternative hit    runaway train soul asylum was this song really about runaway kids i hope not because i think happy memories of high school when i hear it    snow red hot chili peppers i probably should have pointed this out but bands get no more than one song per list that s crucial because these guys could have made it a few times i think this song makes me the happiest when it comes on while i m driving so that s why it made the cut    pride in the name of love u  sure i was upset when they killed martin luther king and i don t like guys getting hurt on a barbed wire fence but as an irish american i m not irish don t call me irish i feel pride when singing u  songs    everlong foo fighters i didn t want to like them but i had to this song is too perfect not to like in fact the foo fighters were great proving that in my world nirvana would be great if it weren t for kurt cobain   super bon bon soul coughing too fat fat you must cut lean another song that was played by at least one cover band in the philadelphia area steamroller picnic it also was the theme song of danny doring in ecw what you don t watch wrestling   sweetness jimmy eat world if you don t like to put this song on and jump around like you re house of pain you aren t a person i d like to go on a road trip with   good better than ezra this was a song i couldn t find on youtube for years and i recently found it on there needless to say my tough work days are a lot smoother   dammit blink     remember when these guys were the it band i do because it was a fantastic time sure we were also dealing with limp bizkit but blink     was so great they made up for it this song is extremely short but it packs a lot of awesomeness into three minutes   high and dry radiohead i hung out with guys from ireland and i think it was a rule they said how great radiohead was every    minutes it was like traffic reports on the  s this was really the only radiohead song that i liked but i loved it it s still on comcast s music on demand quite a bit   summertime sublime i m convinced that if bradley nowell never died sublime would have been an all time great band they are still very good and they were only around for a few years i could probably put four of their songs in my top    but i went with summertime because it was my favorite if you like another one i really can t argue   come out and play keep em separated offspring not only was this raven s entrance song it was also a song that got me fired up all the time it s also a great workout song it s a shame i don t do that   zombie cranberries i remember planning to go to their concert back in      and the lead singer called out sick i think that s why i hate people who take sick days they had a great run and i d like to see them come back to relevance i could probably argue that when you re gone was their best song but i think that s more of a love song   don t look back in anger oasis it sucks when a good band breaks up but it s even worse when their brothers this song

       " 'posted on wednesday    november            cst the more research they do the more evidence ohio state university scientists find that specific elements of marijuana can be good for the aging brain by reducing inflammation there and possibly even stimulating the formation of new brain cells the research suggests that the development of a legal drug that contains certain properties similar to those in marijuana might help prevent or delay the onset of alzheimer s disease though the exact cause of alzheimer s remains unknown chronic inflammation in the brain is believed to contribute to memory impairment gary wenkany new drug s properties would resemble those of tetrahydrocannabinol or thc the main psychoactive substance in the cannabis plant but would not share its high producing effects thc joins nicotine alcohol and caffeine as agents that in moderation have shown some protection against inflammation in the brain that might translate to better memory late in life it s not that everything immoral is good for the brain it s just that there are some substances that millions of people for thousands of years have used in billions of doses and we re noticing there s a little signal above all the noise said gary wenk professor of psychology at ohio state and principal investigator on the research wenk s work has already shown that a thc like synthetic drug can improve memory in animals now his team is trying to find out exactly how it works in the brain the most recent research on rats indicates that at least three receptors in the brain are activated by the synthetic drug which is similar to marijuana these receptors are proteins within the brain s endocannabinoid system which is involved in memory as well as physiological processes associated with appetite mood and pain response this research is also showing that receptors in this system can influence brain inflammation and the production of new neurons or brain cells when we re young we reproduce neurons and our memory works fine when we age the process slows down so we have a decrease in new cell formation in normal aging you need those cells to come back and help form new memories and we found that this thc like agent can influence creation of those cells said yannick marchalant a study coauthor and research assistant professor of psychology at ohio state could people smoke marijuana to prevent alzheimer s disease if the disease is in their family we re not saying that but it might actually work what we are saying is it appears that a safe legal substance that mimics those important properties of marijuana can work on receptors in the brain to prevent memory impairments in aging so that s really hopeful wenk said marchalant described the research in a poster presentation wednesday       at the society for neuroscience meeting in washington d c knowing exactly how any of these compounds work in the brain can make it easier for drug designers to target specific systems with agents that will offer the most effective anti aging benefits said wenk who is also a professor of neuroscience and molecular virology immunology and medical genetics could people smoke marijuana to prevent alzheimer s disease if the disease is in their family we re not saying that but it might actually work what we are saying is it appears that a safe legal substance that mimics those important properties of marijuana can work on receptors in the brain to prevent memory impairments in aging so that s really hopeful wenk said one thing is clear from the studies once memory impairment is evident the treatment is not effective reducing inflammation and preserving or generating neurons must occur before the memory loss is obvious wenk said marchalant led a study on old rats using the synthetic drug called win         win which is not used in humans because of its high potency to induce psychoactive effects the researchers used a pump under the skin to give the rats a constant dose of win for three weeks a dose low enough to induce no psychoactive effects on the animals a control group of rats received no intervention in follow up memory tests in which rats were placed in a small swimming pool to determine how well they use visual cues to find a platform hidden under the surface of the water the treated rats did better than the control rats in learning and remembering how to find the hidden platform old rats are not very good at that task they can learn but it takes them more time to find the platform when we gave them the drug it made them a little better at that task marchalant said in some rats marchalant combined the win with compounds that are known to block specific receptors which then offers hints at which receptors win is activating the results indicated the win lowered the rats brain inflammation in the hippocampus by acting on what is called the trpv  receptor the hippocampus is responsible for short term memory with the same intervention technique the researchers also determined that win acts on receptors known as cb  and cb  leading to the generation of new brain cells a process known as neurogenesis those results led the scientists to speculate that the combination of lowered inflammation and neurogenesis is the reason the rats memory improved after treatment with win the researchers are continuing to study the endocannabinoid system s role in regulating inflammation and neuron development they are trying to zero in on the receptors that must be activated to produce the most benefits from any newly developed drug what they already know is thc alone isn t the answer the end goal is not to recommend the use of thc in humans to reduce alzheimer s marchalant said we need to find exactly which receptors are most crucial and ideally lead to the development of drugs that specifically activate those receptors we hope a compound can be found that can target both inflammation and neurogenesis which would be the most efficient way to produce the best effects the national institutes of health supported this work coauthors on the presentation are holly brothers and lauren burgess both of ohio

       " 'after my recent post about the huge dietary changes i ve made i m sure you re rather surprised to see this big plate of pasta yes i ate some of it it was fantastic i guess this would be a perfect time to tell you a bit more about my approach to low carb eating yes i have almost completely cut grains out of my diet for now and many other things as well i plan on eating this way for the rest of my life because i feel better than i ever have i haven t eaten pasta for about three months and for the most part i really haven t missed it much and that s because i ve never had any intention of completely restricting myself from a food that i love so much i will sometimes eat pasta but when i do it will be with intention it will be made with wonderful fresh ingredients and it will be shared with the ones i love maybe i will only eat a few bites which is what i did last night maybe i will eat a bit more i just don t know yet but one thing i do know is that it will never be a last minute meal thrown together from a box consumed in front of the television never just like pasta i know that sometimes i will eat bread but it will be bread that s worth eating not some strange spongy grocery store loaf filled with preservatives not even the oven warmed or sometimes microwaved flavorless white stuff that comes to the restaurant table needing copious amounts of butter to give it flavor when i eat bread it will be from a favorite bakery in san francisco when the smell of fresh baked loaves is too overwhelming to resist it might be wrapped around the best pulled pork i ve ever tasted from an amazing barbecue joint or perhaps it will come from a friend s oven the first loaf of sourdough from a starter that i shared and maybe it will be from my own oven made with care for those i love it will be an occasional treat and it will be wonderful as you might have guessed the same applies to sweets i will someday add small amounts of honey maple syrup and other sugars the less refined the better to my diet i have no intention of going completely without sweets for the rest of my life but i m also aware of the damage that sugar has done to my body and now that i have abstained from it for so long i can actually feel what it does to me when i do eat some so yes occasionally i ll eat a bite or more of some fantastic looking dessert i ll let myself enjoy it and hopefully i ll stop before it makes me feel horrible but i ve already lost the serious cravings for really sweet things and i love how it s affected my taste buds fruit and vegetables taste amazing now i look forward to a handful of fresh berries from the farmer s market with the same anticipation i used to feel standing in line for pistacchio gelato at my favorite gelateria in catania so now that you know a bit more about how i m eating let s talk about this pasta when the lovely domenica marchetti sent me a message on twitter a while back asking if i d make and share a recipe from her upcoming pasta cookbook i immediately said yes although we haven t actually met in person domenica is one of my favorite people to follow on twitter she s so warm and welcoming i feel like i ve already sat in her kitchen and shared a meal you ll feel the same after reading this book everything about it is warm and welcoming the recipes the writing the photography it s beautiful when i first got the book i took it over to my aunt kathy s house i knew that if i made a big pasta dinner my family would have to be involved i left the book with my cousin and aunt so they could choose a recipe and when i got it back my book looked like this just like me they couldn t choose just one recipe unfortunately i lost track of time and wasn t able to pull together a big homemade pasta dinner for my family but it will definitely happen at some point in the future and this book will definitely play a part since i didn t have time to make some pasta from scratch there are several wonderful recipe for homemade pasta in the book i chose to make domenica s simple tomato cream sauce to pair with some store bought radiatori this gave me an excuse to go to one of my favorite local specialty stores sam s italian deli and market to buy canned san marzano tomatoes for the sauce and to find the special pasta shape i was after not only did sam s carry the dried radiatori pasta they also had a fresh version in their freezer i bought a bag of the fresh pasta which contained two servings perfect since i wasn t cooking for a crowd after all now for the sauce it starts with a combination of extra virgin olive oil and butter my two favorite ingredients when the oil and butter are heated add a mixture of chopped onion carrots and celery while the vegetables are sauteeing you ll have time to process the canned tomatoes in a food mill if you don t have a food mill you really should get one it s an inexpensive and wonderful tool the tomatoes will pass through the mill leaving behind the seeds cores and any skin that was left on the tomatoes what you ll end up with is a beautiful tomato puree after about    minutes the vegetables should be nice and soft even though i was busy with the tomatoes i kept an eye on the vegetables stirring them occasionally and adjusting the heat to keep them from browning much next add the tomato puree salt and pepper to the vegetables and bring it all up to a slow simmer at this point you ll partially cover the pot with a lid then let the sauce simmer for about    minutes meanwhile your house will smell amazing after    minutes the sauce will have thickened and the vegetables will be very tender take the pot off the heat and let it cool for a few minutes next you can puree it with an immersion blender or in batches with a regular blender the final step is to stir in some cream if you d like to freeze part of the sauce remove that portion to a freezer container before adding the cream once the cream is stirred in taste the sauce try not to swoon then add more salt and pepper if you d like while the ingredients are very simple this sauce is amazing i couldn t stop eating it by the spoonful and since i knew i wouldn t be eating much pasta i decided to try the sauce a different way my friend and i had just made grilled chicken under a brick and i couldn t resist trying a piece of the rosemary scented chicken smothered with the tomato cream sauce it was so delicious the thing to keep in mind is that italian pasta sauces can be used in so many ways if you can t eat pasta there s no reason you shouldn t make a big pot of delicious tomato sauce for dinner simmer some big meatballs and vegetables in the sauce pour it over sliced meatloaf chicken or italian sausage toss it with zucchini ribbons or spaghetti squash the options are endless you can do the same thing with any sauce be creative and if you are gluten free but eating other grains you can substitute your favorite gluten free pasta in any of the recipes in the book there are so many recipes in here that can work for anyone yesterday on twitter my friend tari and i were talking about tossing shaved asparagus with a rich cream sauce rather than eating asparagus on the side of fettuccine alfredo it sounded so good i almost dropped what i was doing to go buy some asparagus making dietary changes is hard but rather than worrying about having to say no to your favorite foods try saying yes to new variations of your favorites i am so happy that domenica asked me to join her pasta party to celebrate today s launch of her new book making that sauce yesterday the first pasta sauce i ve made since going low carb really made me think about how to combine my love of italian cooking with my new way of eating i may not be eating pasta very often but the glorious pasta of italy will still inspire many terrific meals in my kitchen domenica is hosting a pasta party on her blog today and several other fantastic bloggers have joined in and tried a recipe

       " 'lisa blumenfeld getty images he fakes to the left passes to the right and then oh wait what is he doing did he just jump over that guy like a hurdle trick plays like these are what many sports fans live for they only happen on rare occasions but when they do and they are successful they leave the other team fans and even some of their own teammates staring here is a list of    of the best trick plays in sports no    south carolina tricks kentucky with secret pass off this is a great trick play south carolina passes off the ball several times keeping it from being seen by kentucky and keeping the wildcats guessing where the ball is while another one of its players runs down the field to get in position to catch and score no    isolation by the redskins in this move the washington redskins create an isolation to give their players time and space to make the touchdown while the maneuver didn t work this particular time it was still obviously a little confusing and surprising for the other team no    team catches opponent off guard in this trick play the team in white seems to catch the team in black off guard with their only half ready appearance on the field which gives one player the chance to run down the field while their quarterback can set up the pass without being worried about being tackled no    keep away in this classic baseball trick play a member of the team in the infield pretends to throw the ball back to the pitcher but actually keeps the ball when the runner thinks he s safe and begins to lean away from the base the infielder still with the ball runs up and tags him out classic trickery on this team s part no    alabama makes fake run against arkansas in this awesome trick play an alabama player secretly hands off the ball to a teammate behind him but continues to run down the field as if he has the ball and is going for the touchdown while the rest of the arkansas team chases down the player they think has the ball the guy actually with the ball sets up a beautiful pass and throws it to another open teammate down the field allowing alabama to score no    pretend trip up and loss of ball in this quick little soccer play the player with the ball pretends to trip over the ball as he is dribbling but really kicks it between the legs of the two guys defending him setting himself up to take the shot and score on goal no    the pop and roll in this beautiful trick play bethel college s quarterback pops the ball up and back behind himself to one of his receivers who is then able to keep himself upright just enough to score no    cleveland browns secret handoff in a series of confusing and lightning fast handoffs the cleveland browns are able to conceal the whereabouts of the ball and run the ball down the field and score no    the fake field goal in this classic trick play lsu fakes a field goal and then runs in for the touchdown no    fake lacrosse pass off similar to the classic hidden ball trick in baseball in this trick play a player pops the ball up as if he s passing it off to a teammate but in all actuality still has possession of the ball he s then able to score while everyone else is looking the other way very sneaky no    pretend fumble and recover the patriots fake a fumble to distract their opponents and when one of their teammates has had a chance to run up the field and get open they recover it and pass for the score no    ole miss secret handoff ole miss pulls one of the greatest secret pass offs of all time in this play at the beginning of the play they hike the ball to one player who then immediately while still crouched down hands it off to another and then runs like he still has the ball the guy actually with the ball is then able to easily set up and execute a run earning ole miss a touchdown no    the fake throw in this trick play the pitcher pretends to throw to his teammate guarding the base and when everyone runs for the ball that wasn t actually thrown the pitcher runs after and tags out the player on that base no    hidden ball lacrosse trick this may be one of the greatest fake passing runs ever to be played in lacrosse in this play boston creates a fake handoff tricking the goalie and allowing it to scorethe play was so smooth and secretive that the other team didn t even seem to know that the other player didn t actually have the ball no    is there something wrong with the ball is there something wrong with the ball coach nope that s just a ploy this team used to trick its opponent into inaction in this play no    cleveland browns secret pass and score here is another amazing trick play from the cleveland browns in this one the browns pass it off shortly and secretly several times to keep the other team guessing where the ball has gone while they re doing this brian robiskie runs down the field and gets open to catch the pass and score a touchdown no   uc irvine gets lsu with hidden ball trick in this amazing trick play a player from uc irvine knows he has no hope of getting the ball to third base before an lsu player touches it so he fakes a throw to the base after the fake he ran up and tagged the runner at second base it was so convincing and well done that the umpire called the lsu player out actually believing he was tagged out even though it was late no   presbyterian college trick play against wake forest this is what i would like to call a bounce pass and no it isn t a basketball trick it s actually a football trick in this play one player bounces the ball across the field to his teammate making the other team believe there has been an incomplete pass but the ball is actually recovered and while all of that distraction was going on another player got into the perfect position to catch the still live ball and score a touchdown no   fake catch and throw in this foreign baseball game an outfielder pretends to catch what was nearly a home run and then proceeds to throw the ball back to the infield keeping the runners from advancing as far as they could have no   left fake this dodge is so effective and convincing that the player is able to shake off all defenders and run the ball for    yards down the field no   the fake pass around this is the greatest trick lacrosse play ever in it one team pretends to pass the ball around and around but in all actuality only one player keeps the ball in his pocket then when the other team is thoroughly confused about where the ball actually is they go for the score no   fake punt and touchdown here is an great example of how effective the fake punt can be in this clip the team running the play was actually able to score a touchdown off the fake no   wrong ball play this is one hilarious and amazing trick play here the maroon team fakes like the ball it has is not the game ball and then hands the ball off to the quarterback while the other team is confused about why the ball isn t the right one the quarterback runs down the field and scores no   pretend fall this is one tricky and potentially dangerous trick play one player approaching the ball pretends to fall while another player comes up from behind and then steals the ball from his fallen teammate creating confusion about who really has the ball on the field i wonder how many people have gotten kicked or hit in the head with the ball in this play no   the walk up this is by far the greatest trick play ever to have been used legally in a game here the quarterback is gently handed the ball and begins to just walk forward while the rest of his team stays in starting position making it look like the play hasn t started yet which causes the other team not to move either once the quarterback has cleared the defensive line he takes off running full sprint and scores with no one in his way to stop him rankings list  multiple sports  sfgate  seattlepi  latimes  philly lists  cool lists  chron lists  national lists and rankings  flagship he fakes to the left  passes

sale of tobacco to anyone who can t flash a licence at the cashier good news for smokers le grand reckons said licence should cost only    bad news he wants to make the application process as deliberately complex as possible you d have to fill out a lengthy form attaching a photograph proof of age and a fee and send it all to a central smoker s permit processing centre and wait for your licence to come back by which point let s face it you would have probably died oh and the licence expires after a year so you have to apply all over again each time it runs out why leave it there why not make it expire every    hours so you have to reapply each morning or include a sudoku on the application form or force the tobacco companies to sell cigarettes inside complicated japanese puzzle boxes or change the name of the brands each week without publicising the change while simultaneously making it illegal for a shop to sell you anything you haven t asked for by name so you have to stand at the counter fishing for codewords for an hour or here s a good one julian make it a requirement for smokers to walk around with a broomhandle stuck through their sleeves running behind the neck so their arms are permanently splayed out like a scarecrow s to spark up under those conditions they d have to work together in pairs flailing around in the outdoor smoking area like something out of it s a knockout his paper incidentally also proposes incentives for large companies to provide a daily exercise hour for staff welcome to your future life having struggled into work suffering withdrawal pangs because today s smoking licence didn t arrive in the post you re forced to spend    minutes doing squat thrusts in the car park and each time you start crying a man in a helmet comes round to gently remind you that it s all for your own good through a loudhailer if that sounds like a nightmare don t worry you can still wriggle out of the squat thrusts provided you re carrying a valid laziness licence whose application process involves climbing a ladder to reach the forms stored at the top of a    ft crane ticking     boxes with a  kg pencil and finally posting it into a motorised mailbox that persistently runs away from you at speeds of up to   mph in other words you still have freedom of choice provided you re carrying a valid freedom of choice permit that is getting your hands on a freedom of choice permit is pretty straightforward the application form requires only your name and signature admittedly you have to deliver it in person to the freedom of choice licensing agency which is open only between     am and     am and is based in an unmarked office in the falklands but nevertheless thousands have already applied if the queues are anything to go by the current waiting time is a mere nine weeks although you d be advised to get there early and guard your place in line because there have been reports of disturbances anyway once you ve got your freedom of choice permit you re free to do as you please within reason provided you notify the central scrutiniser six days in advance of any unapproved activity quoting your    digit freedom of choice permit code in full which isn t printed anywhere on the permit itself but is given to you once and only once whispered quickly into your ear at the desk in the falklands by a man standing beneath a loudspeaker barking out other numbers at random the permit itself incidentally is shaped like a broomhandle and is designed to be threaded through your sleeves at all times if you couldn t be bothered with all that you will just have to do as you re told which isn t that bad to be honest there s a compulsory exercise hour or five and an approved list of foodstuffs but that s about it you will still have at least    minutes a day to do as you please although we ve just banned violent videogames which are bad for your head and there are one or two ideologies we d rather you didn t discuss with friends or on the internet which is why we re not issuing any freedom of speech permits for the time being although if you d like to be notified when they re available simply book

       " 'by diana on march         i finally joined the park slope co op after two years of living in the neighborhood and it s been kind of life changing not because i m suddenly exposed to organic and seasonal food since i ve been buying both for years but because i no longer have to trek out to chinatown for ingredients like lemongrass curry leaves etc and having so much lemongrass close by has made me use regularly in the kitchen again such as for making vietnamese chicken curry and thai lemongrass and ginger iced tea earlier this week i decided to make lemongrass chicken wings as some of you might have guessed by now i love wings and will try to find any excuse to make them whether it s for a summer cookout mid winter tiki party chinese caribbean party or just reviving a homestyle chinese dish that involves coca cola the best way to extract full flavor from lemongrass as i once learned from the ex boyfriend of an old roommate who was a pastry chef is to bruise the white ends of the lemongrass stalk with the blunt edge of your knife s knife before slicing this releases the lemongrass flavor much better than simply chopping the marinade for these wings is plenty flavorful with fish sauce lime juice garlic ginger and shallots to get some nice browning in the oven i baste the wings with a honey and soy sauce mixture during the roasting read the full article tagged as appetizers chicken by diana on march        i had planned on making a nice hearty braised dish today something along the lines of chicken adobo or country captain then i stepped outside to do grocery shopping and got hit with the fact that it was almost    degrees spring was it here for good or is this just another tease not that most of the winter hadn t already felt like spring but it d be nice have some consistency of knowing when to stash away the heavy coats for good a light lunch won out over braised chicken which would have taken almost an hour on the stove in my very warm apartment i remembered there were some carrots in the fridge and a package of soba noodles hanging out in the pack of my cupboard so i picked up a nice big bunch of kale from the store and improvised a lightly cooked soba dish it s a shame that when you order a kale pasta or noodle dish in restaurants it usually comes speckled with kale like if it were just a garnish i like my kale in big bunches i will eat pasta with a bowl of extra kale on the side if it can t all fit on the plate so here is my rendition of a kale noodle dish done right with generous amounts of the iron rich green and the soba is wonderful tossed with a light sesame dressing i topped everything off with furikake one of the all natural brands without msg for some seaweed flavor and extra nuttiness but if you don t have any on hand feel free to just sprinkle on toasted white sesame seeds read the full article tagged as noodles recipes vegetarian by diana on march        have you ever had vietnamese chicken curry or c  ri g  i broke out my dutch oven again last week to make this a sublime dish of braised chicken in a mild curry with carrots and potatoes curry is a lesser known part of vietnamese cuisine than it is in thai cuisine but restaurants really should highlight it more in their menus it s hard not to love a dish that s a natural amalgam of   distinct cultures curry traveled vietnam from india c  ri is vietnamese for curry and g  means chicken over time cooks in vietnam adapted the dish to use local ingredients and to suit local palates such as adding fish sauce lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf and of the long standing french influence a warm crusty baguette became the de facto side though rice also works although not as fiery as indian or thai curries c  ri g  is by no means bland it s aromatic with coconut milk lemongrass and kaffir lime and the generous amount of fish sauce means that no table salt is needed and you can improvise with this recipe use a bay leaf if you can t find kaffir lime leaves to kick up the heat feel free to add some dried red chili flakes you can also substitute sweet potatoes or taro for the potatoes what you really shouldn t do though is hover over the stove in the last    minutes of cooking with your baguette ripping off pieces and dipping them into the curry just to taste because one bite will turn into    and because the pieces will get larger and larger until half that wonderful loaf is gone before you even put anything on the table trust me on this read the full article tagged as chicken recipes vietnamese ',\n",

       " 'nobody is naysaying the wonders of modern medicine what would we do without a medication like penicillin to treat infections but as it turns out everyday items have secret curing powers too next time you don t want to fork over money to get a common wart removed consider using duct tape already popped two aspirin but can t get rid of the headache a pencil could do the trick below get medical explanations behind a few bizarre albeit brilliant macgyver esque home remedies duct tape to remove warts in      a group of doctors compared duct tape s effectiveness with liquid nitrogen in removing warts after two months of wearing duct tape on a daily basis and using a pumice stone about once a week to exfoliate the dead skin    percent of patients warts were gone whereas freezing only removed    percent the question is whether there is something in the chemical adhesive itself or if the occlusion suffocation causes the destruction of the wart says new york city based dermatologist robin blum md the other thinking is that the duct tape causes irritation which stimulates our body s immune cells to attack the wart photo thinkstock vapor rub to cure nail fungus while there are no studies to prove coating infected toenails with vapor rub once or twice a day is an effective treatment for nail fungus a basic internet search results in a number of personal testaments to the medicinal ointment s fungus killing powers i ve heard many patients say that vapor rub does help but i m not exactly sure why dr blum admits while some argue it s the menthol in the balm that kills the fungus and others say it s the smothering effect of the thick gel if used consistently vapor rub has been shown to get rid of not just the fungus but the infected toenail too which will turn black and eventually fall off when the new nail grows in it should be fungus free photo thinkstock oatmeal to soothe eczema this is absolutely true as oats have anti inflammatory properties dr blum says whether it s used as a paste or poured into a bath most experts recommend choosing colloidal finely ground oatmeal and soaking the affected area for at least    minutes in addition to reducing inflammation oats are thought to have an antihistamine effect dr blum says by lowering levels of histamine which triggers inflammation as part of the immune system s recovery response she explains oats prevent or reduce the redness photo thinkstock yogurt to cure bad breath bad breath comes from a number of places the two most common being the mouth and the stomach the neutralizing powers of yogurt and other probiotics treat the latter cause yogurt shouldn t have any effect at all on the bacteria that live on the tongue because it s not there long enough says robert meltzer md a new york city based gastroenterologist and attending physician at lenox hill hospital however it likely has a neutralizing effect on the acid that resides anywhere between the mouth and the stomach including the back of the throat and the esophagus he explains i think almost any milk product or food that contains live cultures would have the same effect while yogurt can get rid of bad breath that results from gastrological conditions like acid reflux it won t have any real effect on bad breath that is the product of gum liver or lung disease says ohio based dentist matthew messina dds photo thinkstock a spoonful of sugar to cure hiccups in      edgar engelman md conducted a study to find out if a spoonful of sugar really is an effective cure for hiccups he assembled a group of    patients who had been experiencing intractable hiccups for more than six hours eight of whom had had them anywhere from a full day to six weeks each of the test subjects was given one teaspoon of white granulated sugar to swallow dry and for    of the    hiccup patients the cure was immediate andr  dubois md a gastroenterologist in bethesda maryland noted in the doctors book of home remedies that the sugar is probably acting in the mouth to modify the nervous impulses that would otherwise tell the muscles in the diaphragm to contract spasmodically photo istockphoto bite a pencil to cure a headache while doctors aren t sure why we do it clenching our teeth is a common side effect of stress according to fred sheftell md director of the new england center for headache in stamford connecticut when we clench up we strain the muscle that connects the jaw to the temples which can trigger a tension headache by placing a pencil between our teeth but not biting down we relax our jaw muscles which eradicates tension and reduces pain just remember the remedy really only applies to tension headaches not migraines or headaches caused by sinus pressure etc photo thinkstock olives for motion sickness according to the national library of medicine there are a number of symptoms that present themselves as a result of motion sickness including increased salivation which is the body s way of protecting the teeth from the high doses of acid accompanied by vomit enter olives which contain tannins that when released in the mouth work to dry saliva first eliminating the symptom and then the body s instinct to follow suit however the treatment is only effective during the early stages of nausea when the salivation changes first appear photo thinkstock gargle salt water for a sore throat when you were a kid and had a sore throat your mom likely made you gargle warm water with salt in it and she was definitely on to something according to douglas hoffman md phd author of the website the medical consumer s advocate a sore throat is an inflammatory response of the infected tissues and the salt helps draw out the excess fluid to temporarily decrease swelling and the pain it causes most remedies call for a ratio of   tablespoon salt to   ounces of water but it s always better to opt for more salt rather than less just keep in mind that you are treating the symptoms not the illness as dr hoffman notes on his website the relief is very real but also tends to be short lived since the gargle has done nothing to remove the cause of the sore throat photo thinkstock health

of itself it begins to exacerbate itself a bit when you hear news about android becoming the largest and fastest growing smartphone operating system this means that as consumers increasingly move away from so called dumbphones it s grows less and less likely that you ll be able to video chat with your new friend on your phone luckily there are a huge number of cross platform smartphone apps that allow you to work your way around this problem here s a list of our insert number favourite apps available on both ios as well as android tango a free video chat service that functions much like apple s ballyhooed facetime however aside from allowing iphone owners to talk to android users it also doesn t restrict you to using wifi for calls while video chat on  g can admittedly be rather spotty at times it still manage to serve its purpose fantastically while not confining you to any specific platform whatsapp if there s one thing that all mobile phone users can agree on it s that text messaging rates are inordinately high combat the problem by grabbing the whatsapp messenger from either the app store or android market whatsapp allows those who own the application to send text messages to each other without the usual sms charges and with additional availability for both blackberry as well as nokia s symbian you ll find yourself with a much larger ecosystem of users facebook probably goes without saying but having a facebook account is almost a necessity in this day and age though the android facebook application initially lagged behind its iphone counterpart in terms of

this rule tweetdeck s columnar layout makes sorting through direct messages mentions and of course the users you follow a simple and intuitive process furthermore with the ability to add additional custom columns tweetdeck is almost essential for those who use more than one twitter account spotify pandora this of course is heavily dependent on where you happen to live but both streaming music

       " 'dependable that s what cast iron is it will last for centuries if properly cared for and it has a natural non stick surface that s eco friendly when i was a bride my granny gave me two of her cast iron skillets a tiny   inch one for making cornbread for two and a    inch skillet for everything else she told me all i d ever need to be a good cook was those two skillets a sauce pan a stock pot and a casserole dish and in a pinch she said i didn t really even need the casserole cast iron has been around for hundreds of years before fancy teflon cookware was even a notion cast iron was the standard for good cooks everywhere dependable that s what cast iron is it will last for centuries if properly cared for and it has a natural non stick surface that s eco friendly you can bake a pan of cornbread scramble some eggs make your favorite vegetarian black bean chili or sear a perfect steak cast iron cookware is the definition of all purpose if you don t already have a cast iron skillet here are a few reasons to go to your nearest resale shop or garage sale and begin looking for one you won t regret it top   reasons why cast iron cookware is so green cast iron is naturally non stick properly seasoned see below nothing will stick to it cast iron eliminates the need for the costly toxic chemicals used to create the non stick surfaces in modern cookware eco easy clean up all cast iron cookware requires for clean up is hot water and a stiff brush so you avoid any harmful chemicals in detergent or solvents cast iron can take the heat it can withstand much hotter temperatures and will distribute the heat more evenly than traditional cookware and since it holds heat well you can use less energy to cook plus it s perfect for outdoor cooking just remember that cast iron gets hot so use an oven mitt when handling a hot pan it s a great upcycling opportunity don t ever worry about buying a cast iron skillet or other cast iron cooking vessel like a dutch oven from a resale shop or garage sale even if it looks rusty and dirty it can be cleaned and re seasoned and continue on cooking forever it s good for you cast iron cookware leaches small amounts of iron into food so you get a little extra iron each time you use it almost anyone especially women in their child bearing years will benefit from this how to properly season cast iron cookwarefirst wash your cast iron cookware this is the only time you will need soap to clean it but you want to be sure you remove any dust or dirt if you have a brand new cast iron piece you will need to do this to remove the wax coating that is on it to keep it from rusting until it s seasoned coat your piece in some type of oil cast iron has a porous surface the seasoning process will fill and smooth the surface to make it non stick some type of oil is used to facilitate this process i use crisco vegetable shortening traditionalists would use lard you can use plain old cooking oil too but you will get better results with crisco you want to coat the entire cooking surface with the shortening don t glob it on but every nook and cranny should have a nice medium layer of shortening use about as much as you would use to coat a cake pan for baking bake it in the oven next you just pre heat your oven to     degrees and put your cast iron pan in for an hour or so after heating turn off the oven and let it cool completely while still in the oven then it s ready to go heating the cookware creates the oxidation that prevents rust and makes the surface non stick some cast iron users advocate heating the pan slightly before applying the crisco to ensure that the pan is completely dry and to open the pores of the pan before seasoning not a bad idea but remember cast iron gets hot use oven mitts newly seasoned cast iron will take on a dark brown coating after long use it will become glossy black the non stick properties of the pan will increase with time and use so use your cast iron often remember seasoning is a process even though cast iron can be used immediately after the first seasoning your cookware will get better and better over time how do i re season a used cast iron piece if you buy a cast iron piece second hand the process is still basically the same to re season it with one exception first wash it in hot soapy water as above then i put it in my oven on the highest setting or on the self cleaning setting if you have one and let it bake for a few hours without any oil or shortening this will remove any rust and the old seasoning let it cool then follow the steps above to re season caring for your cast iron cookwareafter each use clean your piece with very hot water and scrub with a stiff brush to remove any particles left behind don t use soap it will remove the seasoning after you scrub the pan give it a light coating with some crisco or vegetable oil and store it in the oven why because the oven will have less moisture this will help keep your cast iron from ever rusting plus each time you use your oven is an opportunity to further season your pan even if you take your cast iron pan out while using your oven give it a light coating of shortening before putting it back in the warm oven especially if it s a new piece this will help develop the seasoning further i have treasured those skillets granny gave me and i ve added to my collection over the years a dutch oven in      and a griddle just last year at a garage sale in los angeles about    years ago i bought a giant deep skillet that turned out to be called a texas skillet an omen i guess since i live in texas now i love my cast iron cookware i m guessing you will too dependable  that s what cast iron is  it will last for centuries if properly cared for  and it has a natural non stick surface that s eco friendly  cast iron  cooking  cornbread  skillet  food  cookware',\n",

       " 'how brad pitt got in shape for films like fight club and troy celebrities such as brad pitt are notorious for completely transforming themselves within a few months to get ready for a certain film role over the years brad pitt has slimmed bulked and cut for various roles lets take a look at some of those movies over the last    years that have seen pitt take on the challenge of shaping up in brad pitts early years photos show just how slim he was in     s thelma louise pitt had a visibly much leaner look this was actually his more natural build many would class pitts body type as an ectomorph which is someone that is typically classed as a hard gainer is flat chested lean lightly muscled someone who takes longer than the average person to gain muscle and generally of thin build being in his twenties at this time diet and hard training was not that important to him he naturally had a fast metabolism and only did some occasional weight training preparing for thelma and louise it was ab training where he spent much more attention being naturally lean certainly helped pitt with getting his abs in really good condition for the film it was not until appearing in fight club nine years later in      that people really took attention to pitts physique hed clearly trained and dieted hard in preparation for this one after fight club was released pitt became the envy of many men his tight body was coveted and many people sought a workout that would produce similar results however contrary to what most people thought pitt was actually at his lightest weighing in at only         pounds with body fat around     it has been well documented that pitt had an extremely regimented routine for the months before filming began his workout was characterized by beating one muscle group up each day then giving it the rest of the week to recover similar to the kind of routine a professional bodybuilder would do finally at the end of the week he finished off with a good cardio workout this put his body into fat burning mode which served to shed any extra padding that covered his muscles giving him that chiselled and ripped look here are the exercises that made up his fight club workout   sets of each exercise taking approximately    seconds of rest between each set pitt used a weight challenging enough that he could successfully complete    reps no less with the exception of pushups and pullups but be fatigued on the last rep proper form was maintained throughout monday chest    pushups nautilus chest press nautilus incline press pec deck machine chest fly tuesday back   pullups seated rows lat pulldowns t bar rows wednesday shoulders arnold dumbbell press like a military press but start the action with palms facing in and end the action with palms facing out lateral raises front raises thursday biceps triceps nautilus curl machine ez cable curls hammer curls tricep pushdowns friday cardio walking or preferably running on the treadmill for    minutes at    to    of your maximum heart rate saturday sunday rest nutrition diet brad s diet is the most important aspect when it comes to getting him in shape for a role don t just think he trains hard in the gym his diet accounts for much of his success in achieving the physique produces for his fight club role pitt took on a very strict and consistent diet eating six small meals a day which included a whey protein powder and on occasion some protein bars no other supplements were used by pitt however much of his nutrition came from whole foods high in protein like chicken turkey fish lean meat eggs and cottage cheese carbohydrates were very clean and included wholewheats and grains green vegetables oats and rice cakes which were then tapered off in his last two meals of the day breakfast would be   eggs   whites   yellow and   g of oatmeal with raisins occasionally pitt would replace the eggs with a protein shake if his schedule was tight midmorning snack tinned tuna in wholewheat pitta breads lunch   x chicken breasts       g brown rice or pasta and green veggies mid afternoon snack pre workout protein bar or whey protein shake and a banana post workout whey protein shake and a banana dinner grilled fish or chicken brown rice or pasta vegetables and salad evening snack casein protein shake protein shake or low fat cottage cheese slow release protein would you like a diet workout plan based on brad s fight club physique we can set up a plan in just    hours more info here by      when he began production of the movie snatch pitts body fat percentage had rose to approximately   which was still very lean some would argue that he actually looks even leaner in snatch but not according to pitt staying at the     he had maintained for fight club would not have been healthy he cut to get the fight club look that was required for such a film after the film he relaxed his cardio and strict diet to ease himself into a more normal and manageable physique so what you see in snatch are his heavy bulking efforts combined with a less strict diet pitt did not follow such a regimented program for snatch infact he barely trained at all five years later pitt was given an even more challenging body transformation he needed to add       pounds of solid muscle for the movie troy      in order for pitt to get ready for the role he dropped cigarettes and sharply cut back on beer and chips although he did allow himself the occasional treat mcflurry shakes from mcdonald s though it was more for a little taste of home you know a little americana pitt stated in a      interview brad used a low carb high protein diet during the training for his role physically pitt prepared for the role with a year of intense training the first three months were daunting and not fun at all his days included two hours in the gym two additional hours of sword work and four high protein low carb meals as a result he gained about       pounds of brawn as you can see in the photos pitt was in pretty impressive shape in troy good muscle size and great proportion he was also not looking so top heavy as he had in previous films meaning his legs looked too skinny compared to his upper body in troy hed visibly put some good mass on his thighs which gave him a good overall appearance and a more proportionate physique weight training wise pitt bought down the rep ranges compared to when he trained for fight club he also lifted heavier this enabled him to add some muscle bulk so in summary pitt exemplifies that through hard work and dedication someone who may not be genetically gifted at building muscle mass can actually overcome these barriers pitt would probably be the first to admit that he doesnt have the perfect body but most would argue that he does represent what most guys would love to look like time to get training want a body like brad pitt in fight club for a full program based on brad pitt s training principles

       " 'it was the first film i ever wanted to own it was the love story that taught me everything i needed to know about never settling for anything less than a man who will untie your robe and slide you lower back first across a piano and smile lovingly as he watches you cry at your first opera and it was the dialogue classic lines like if i forget to tell you later i had a really nice time tonight and she rescues him right back that would lace my conversations and pad my dear john letters for as of today    years on march         the romcom classic pretty woman premiered clinching richard gere his third straight decade as one of hollywood s sexiest and most versatile leading men and established julia roberts as so much more than a shock of gorgeous hair and an ear to ear smile the two of them gere then    and roberts a very new    who only took the role after several actresses molly ringwald and daryl hannah among them passed weren t a likely couple which in the opening scenes of the film keep you from ever guessing their characters workaholic businessman edward lewis and wig wearing working girl vivian ward would go on to serve as one of the most sustaining cinematic love stories in modern film history while it s usually the case that we attribute a film s success to its most visible contributors with pretty woman which until just before its release was to be called       referring to the amount edward would pay vivian for her six days of companionship there is a star beyond the actors beyond director garry marshall and even beyond that hippie stringbean at the end who shouts what s your dream everybody s got a dream that person is veteran costume designer marilyn vance the woman who took vivian from thigh high patent boots to a floor sweeping off the shoulder red gown vance a brooklyn native who now resides in los angeles not only styled the clothing you see in pretty woman she also designed selected all fabrics and took haute couture care of every outfit s every single stitch aside from a pair of chanel heels and the tie vivian wears with nothing else to greet edward with when he returns to the hotel after work vance and her team created every last one of the iconic fashion moments in the oscar nominated film vance who last year received the career achievement award by the costume designers guild for her    years in the business began her career when she suited phoebe cates in the red norma kamali two piece in fast times at ridgmont high gained momentum when she literally forced molly ringwald into the pink patchwork prom dress in pretty in pink and reached fever pitch when she slipped patrick swayze into nothing but tight sweatpants and high tops in the tai chi scene in your author s second favorite film road house quite simply if it was a movie born in the   s and   s and one you love more today than you did back then vance was likely the hands on deck designer in an interview i ve been waiting to conduct since i unwrapped my very first vhs copy of pretty woman on that christmas morning back in      vance graciously fielded my many many questions and discusses among other things how incredibly patient gere and roberts were during their marathon of fittings how one of the most famous red dresses in film history almost wasn t red and what might ve happened to the polo match hat had she not been able to find enough brown and white polka dot fabric julia was so young when you worked with her on pretty woman what was she like back then she was just so new back then       years old i think she was so terrific to work with and so patient i can t even tell you how patient she was fittings for hours color tests for hours and she never complained not once fittings for hours is that unusual these days it is unless you re working on a period piece or something that requires a lot of original costuming because the theme of the film is very specific in a certain way most of the time now it s all styling for pretty woman and all the films i did back in the   s and   s it wasn t styling it was actual costuming i designed and had made almost everything you see on screen my team and i did all of that you designed the red opera dress yes and did you know that it almost wasn t red the studio really wanted black but i knew it needed to be red before the decision was made we ended up having to create three different dresses we took every color lit it and shot her poor julia had to sit for so many color test shots for that one dress finally i was able to find the right shade and convince everyone to go my direction pretty woman wouldn t have been pretty woman had that dress been black what were they thinking laughing i knew what i was doing and what s so funny about that dress is that every year since its release western costumes the manufacturer that cut the pattern for the dress gets multiple requests from men who send in their significant other s measurements to have it recreated they want to recreate the entire scenario that is incredible i knew women loved that film but to have men get involved what s odd is that these men are almost always from texas who

free they should be fun you are there to enjoy the party as well you deserve it just as much as your guests do if not more what you have to do is make one easy dish one that is packed with flavor and is set to impress often times people get overly ambitious and think they need to make something with exotic ingredients they base a recipe s excellence on the amount of ingredients listed however the simple reality is that less is more all you need are a few simple and well thought out ingredients to create a show stopping meal for instance take normal everyday chicken breasts some good hearty crimini mushrooms onions garlic sour cream a few spices and herbs here and there and while you are at it a pound of healthy whole wheat egg noodles why you got yourself a meal fit for a king or queen i m an equal opportunist conscious what can i say wipe that look of confusion off of your face what can you make with said ingredients well thank you for asking my young grasshopper you can make chicken stroganoff chicken what now well chicken stroganoff of course make this classic dish reinvented for the dinner party and the ooohs and ahhhs will just come rolling in the joneses will hate you for it you ll be a star people will want to be you i can see that look of intrigue in your eyes how do you make chicken stroganoff you ask well let me show you how just put your trust in your ol cooking conscious here and i will teach you how to make such a dish we begin with our simple yet incredibly delicious ingredients we first have to start by preparing the chicken i know i know what does that mean what are we preparing it for is it going out what should it wear we re preparing it for cooking silly chickens don t wear clothes you ll need   chicken breasts tip you can also use dark meat if you d like or a mixture of both white and dark for a tasty combination   chicken breasts are probably more than enough for   people i however don t like it when you re eating a dish of some sort and you need a magnifying glass to find the meat so i fixed the problem by adding another chicken breast feel free to add more if you are having more people over cut each chicken breast into thin slices i use a plastic cutting board to cut the raw chicken i have one that is solely designated to cut raw protein never cut raw chicken or meat on a wooden cutting board it can hold bacteria if you do it can cause cross contamination and create diseases people could get seriously sick did i scare you enough to get a plastic cutting only for raw meat and chicken then cut each strip into chunks chicken chunks slivers chicken slivers nuggets chicken nuggets cut all the chicken like this and throw it into a bowl tip you can also make this the classic way with beef just swap out the chicken for top sirloin roast instead it s time to season the chicken here s what you ll need garlic powder onion powder paprika crushed red pepper salt pepper thyme give it a toss eh just use your hands why not just make sure you wash your mittens really well along with the cutting board and knife you used sanitation is key don t cross contaminate anything this has been a psa for the prevention of salmonella toss the chicken and spices until evenly coated we re now going to cook this here chicken start by heating a large pot i like using a heavy duty dutch oven over medium high heat drizzle in a bit of olive oil you ll most definitely have to cook the chicken in batches do not overcrowd the pot because if you do the chicken wont really brown and caramelize rather it will just steam and boil developing no color or flavor no one wants that so lesson of the day do not crowd you should brown hey that rhymes cook the chicken about     minutes per side flipping once to develop a nice caramelization on the chicken nuggets the chicken slivers the chicken chunks you are not really cooking the chicken all the way through just browning it it will continue to cook later on so once the chicken is golden brown use a slotted spoon to scoop up and transfer to a plate while you continue cooking the rest continue in batches until all the chicken is browned at some point during the process you might need to add more oil if it needs some allow the chicken to rest on a plate while we proceed to the next steps of the meal when all the chicken is browned let s cut and cook some veggies start with an onion cut off the ends slice in half and remove the skin then give it a dice let s also chop the garlic while we re at it you ll need about three cloves of garlic try to use fresh garlic whenever possible the flavor is just unbeatable i would shy away from using the already chopped garlic in a jar it isn t as fresh as it could be tip if you have an aversion to chopping garlic or just do not like to do it use a microplane or handheld grater to grate the garlic instead in the last post i grated it in this post i decided to chop it what can i say i m fickle so to the pot where you cooked the chicken add a bit more oil if there was not enough left over and don t worry about the browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pot that is nothing but flavor later on when we start to cook the veggies it ll lift up from the pan and create a great tasting sauce trust me so toss in the chopped onion and garlic stir and allow to cook until translucent and caramelized while the onions and garlic cook this is your opportunity to prepare the mushrooms i like to use crimini mushrooms for this dish i feel like they have more flavor than the ordinary plain white button variety but that s just me feel free to use whichever kind of mushroom you like best there s a myth out there in the foodie world that if you wash mushrooms under running water they toughen up on you now i do not know if this is true as i ve never tried it out of fear so to not take any chances i always just wipe down my mushrooms with damp paper towels i do not want tough mushrooms do you some things are not worth risking mushrooms are those things after you have wiped them down remove the stems you can save the stems for later i know what you are thinking what on earth will i use these stems for conscious well do not fret my friend tip you can freeze them and use them in a vegetable stock later on or throw them into soups to make them more flavorful anyhow i digress let s focus our attention back to the mushrooms slice them thinly okay throw them into the pot give them a toss to mix in with the onions and garlic if there is one thing you take away from my blog well honestly i m hoping you learn a lot of things not just one but if there is one lesson that sticks to you it should be to season as you go season every layer seasoning is key so once you add the mushrooms season with a bit of salt and pepper a pinch and a dash or a dash and a pinch stir once more and cook until golden brown now let s make a roux what is a roux you ask well thank you for asking a roux is a fancy schmancy cooking term for a thickening agent it s basically just flour and fat usually butter mixed together that s it nothing fancy about it huh anyhow the roux will thicken our sauce so make a well in the center of the pot in the center drop in the butter let s take a moment to just admire the beautiful picture above it isn t because i took the picture no it s what the picture shows mushrooms garlic onions and butter is there anything better serve this on a plate for me right now and i m golden i could just stop the post here and say we re finished we could eat this together and be happy but i suppose we have to finish the entire dish i guess add in the flour stir that together and allow to cook for about a minute you want to cook out that raw flour flavor say that five times fast it should start to smell nutty next stream in the chicken stock if you re making beef stroganoff you can use beef stock instead while you re at it dump in the worchestire sauce as well give it one giant colossal stir okay maybe a couple stirs allow the sauce to bubble boil and thicken i just got a vision of us gathered around a cauldron wearing pointed hats laughing maniacally why is that remember the browned chicken how could you forget those precious nuggets slivers and chunks throw it into the hot tub this is where the chicken will continue to cook stir it into the sauce allow to simmer for about      minutes on low this will let the chicken cook and get tender in the meantime you can cook the egg noodles i m using a whole wheat egg noodle i mean because why not might as well be healthy cook the noodles until slightly tender or al dente if you want to be fancy so the noodles are al dente look at us we re being fancy truthfully i used whole wheat noodles because the next ingredient isn t as healthy so i m offsetting we do not have to feel guilty about the sour cream because we used whole wheat noodles that works right next step is the sour cream what i tell ya and do not use some of that low fat or fat free sour cream stuff here there s no place for those things in this recipe or any for that matter i always say if i m going to use something like sour or heavy cream i m going to use the good stuff i ll go all the way anyhow sour cream is a classic stroganoff ingredient it gives it that creamy look and taste to it and of course like many dishes there are a wide variety of recipes and variations out there the popular variation uses sour cream so i m using sour cream remember that important tip season every layer add a tad bit more salt and pepper now before i get e mails about how i add a ton of salt to everything i m only adding a tiny bit here and there it s not like i m throwing in a tablespoon of salt each time it s a pinch season to taste it s important to taste as you go along that s how you make sure the seasoning is correct if it tastes good then you re good so stir once again allow to come to a small boil a simmer it s ready let s serve this dish up you can do this in one of two ways   you can toss in the noodles into the pot and stir it all together or   you can do what i do to impress your family or guests and arrange the noodles on platter top with the chicken stroganoff there all done looks good right it s missing something though a little color you eat with your eyeballs first or something like that that up there is parsley but i m sure you knew this already that up there is flat leaf parsley i like it better than the curly kind it has more flavor in my opinion and i m your cooking conscious so you take my opinion give it a rough chop sprinkle it over the chicken stroganoff okay now we re done bam sorry emeril dinner is served make this for dinner one night your family will love it having a party make this for the party your guests will love it live by yourself make this for yourself you will love it i like to make this for a quick weekday dinner i ll serve it with a simple green salad or saut ed green beans i also like to put an extra dollop of sour cream when i serve it what it tastes good that way it s a very simple meal many people think that stroganoff is rather complicated to make that it takes hours to cook but that isn t the case it s super simple right you can make this no sweat okay i ll stop with the images now have i tempted you enough to make it come on you know you want to print this chicken stroganoff you can easily make this dish the classic way with beef just swap out the chicken for top sirloin roast and the chicken stock for beef stock yield serves     ingredients   chicken breasts trimmed   tablespoons olive oil   teaspoon garlic powder   teaspoon onion powder     teaspoon paprika     teaspoon red pepper flakes   teaspoon fresh thyme leaves   tablespoon

toss thoroughly to combine drizzle in about   tablespoon of the oil into the preheated pot and cook the chicken in batches being careful not to overcrowd the pan brown the chicken about     minutes on each side do not worry about cooking it all the way this step is just to develop color and flavor continue saut ing the chicken in batches until it is all browned transferring the finished pieces onto a plate to rest throw in the remaining tablespoon of oil and add the chopped onions and garlic to the pot stir occasionally and allow to caramelize until the onions are soft and translucent add the sliced mushrooms season with a pinch of salt and pepper and stir coating the mushrooms completely with the oil onions and garlic cook for about   minutes or until the mushrooms are browned make a well in the center of the pot add the butter and flour mixing together to make a roux cook for about   minute to let the raw flour taste cook off then stream in the chicken stock while you mix everything together add the worchestire sauce and stir once more lower the heat to low and allow the sauce to thicken and bubble slightly throw in the chicken along with the juices and continue to cook on a simmer for about      minutes in the meantime follow the instructions on the egg noodle package to cook pasta should be slightly tender or al dente drain and let sit for a minute while you finish the sauce to the sauce and chicken add the sour cream and season once more with a pinch of salt and pepper stir together and bring to a simmer toss in the egg noodles and sprinkle with the chopped parsley for garnish or you can arrange the cooked pasta on a serving platter and just spoon over the chicken stroganoff on top garnish with a dollop of sour cream and chopped parsley serve right away stroganoff can be made in advance and stored in the fridge when ready to serve just reheat on the stove and cook the noodles then simply toss together enjoy    august      by jonathan categories main

       " 'in january      the kfc national council advertising cooperative the group that reps u s franchisees decided to sue kentucky fried chicken kfc to get control of the advertising strategy this came in the wake of poor sales second quarter revenue at american kfcs those open for a year or more decreased   percent   many franchisees have voiced disapproval over a couple kfc decisions last year the company introduced grilled chicken and the slogan unthink kfc recently however sales of grilled chicken have sunk according to larry starkey owner of seven kfc franchises are people beginning to unthink kfc and grilled chicken carcinogen this month a medical non profit s lawsuit over a carcinogen found in grilled chicken is set to continue after a california appeals court reversed a ruling   physicians committee for responsible medicine pcrm tested grilled chicken samples from several chain restaurants including ones from mcdonald s the organization said in court filings that the tests found the presence of a carcinogenic chemical called phip which is produced through the cooking process used by the fast food chains so the committee filed suit saying that the restaurants are required to post warnings under a california law which stipulates that businesses cannot expose individuals to chemicals known to cause cancer without first giving clear and reasonable warning the restaurants countered that the state rule was preempted because such signage would contradict federal efforts to guarantee that food was cooked sufficiently to prevent the spread of food borne illness the restaurants all know that the grilled chicken has a cancer causing agent in them said neal barnard president of the physicians group they ought to share with you what they know mcdonald s referred comment to the california restaurant association where spokesman daniel conway lambasted the charges of misleading consumers he said the levels of phip in grilled chicken didn t merit concern and that a proliferation of signs like the ones demanded in the suit would do nothing more than cause consumers to ignore warnings of greater consequence my biggest message is that grilled chicken is safe he said bottom line but what do the scientists say this year about         americans are expected to die of cancer more than       people a day   while thirty percent of cancers are caused by tobacco dietary factors also play a significant role in cancer risk at least one third of annual cancer deaths in the u s are due to dietary factors a recent review on diet and cancer estimates that up to    percent of cancers of the large bowel breast and prostate are due to dietary factors   estimated percentages of cancer due to selected factors   diet    to    tobacco    air and water pollution   alcohol   radiation   medications   numerous research studies have shown that cancer is much more common in populations consuming diets rich in fatty foods particularly meat and much less common in countries eating diets rich in grains vegetables and fruits   while fruits and vegetables contain a variety of vitamins minerals antioxidants and phytochemicals to protect the body by contrast recent research shows that animal products contain potentially carcinogenic compounds which may contribute to increased cancer risk   meat meat naturally contains amino acids and a protein called creatine that is found in muscle tissue when meat is grilled this combination of amino acids and creatine form heterocyclic amines hcas a major compound of hcas is amino imidazo pyridines phip which is the compound found most abundantly in cooked meats   meat need not be well done or charred to contain hcas testing has found hcas in grilled chicken cooked for just three minutes on each side hcas can pose a cancer risk even when consumed in small amounts no safe level of phip linked to several forms of cancer has been identified it appears to increase cancer risk even at very low levels   an analysis by cancer project organization has revealed that grilled chicken has more than    times the amount of hcas than grilled beef nearly all the hcas detected were in the form of phip the table below lists the five foods containing the highest levels of hcas the five worst foods to grill food item hcas nanograms per     grams chicken breast skinless boneless grilled well done        nanograms     grams  steak grilled well done     nanograms     grams  pork barbecued     nanograms     grams  salmon grilled with skin     nanograms     grams  hamburger grilled well done     nanograms     grams      gram portion equals about     ounces grilled vegetarian foods the cancer project organization recommends plant based foods which do not contain hcas because creatine is found in muscle tissue not in plant based foods vegetarian foods do not produce detectable levels of hcas when they are grilled these healthful grilling options include soy based veggie burgers vegetable kebabs barbecued tofu and portabella mushroom steaks these foods are also low in fat and cholesterol they may be low in fat and cholesterol but are they safe to eat arsenic to fight the boll weevil in the     s u s cotton growers spread a pesticide that contained arsenic an effective killer the pesticide was also used against the gypsy moth yet it had an unexpected side effect the soil of the fields and forests where it was applied remains laced with low levels of arsenic    arsenic can t be broken down to harmless by products it stays in the soil unless rain or irrigation water washes it into the groundwater or a plant like rice which is now farmed on the old cotton fields takes it up into its stems leaves and grains some plants can draw arsenic and other metals into their leaves and stems at doses that would easily kill other plants scientists call these plants hyperaccumulators unfortunately some food plants particularly rice are also very good at drawing in arsenic from the soil in july      scientists in japan and the united kingdom reported why rice mistakes arsenic for silicon which is essential    silicon stiffens the rice stems and leaves keeping the plants from falling over or lodging when their seed heads get heavy it helps the rice plant grow stronger husks and also protects the seed against fungus poultry today poultry producers also use arsenic against parasites they have sometimes supplemented chicken feed with roxarsone a compound containing arsenic to control parasites and promote weight gain most of this arsenic is excreted by the birds and then becomes mixed in with sawdust and other litter materials used in poultry houses farmers then typically use the litter as a nutrient rich and free fertilizer for amending their crop soils    the use of organoarsenicals in the poultry industry primarily roxarsone has increased as the industry has grown concentrations of roxarsone normally added to feed are relatively low between    and    g t   however in areas of intensive poultry production such as the delmarva delaware maryland virginia peninsula the application of roxarsone derived arsenic to agricultural soils can be quite acute    in      approximately             broilers were raised on the peninsula resulting in an estimated annual load of arsenic to delmarva soils of        kg from land application of poultry litter    arsenic and health arsenic is a known human carcinogen chronic exposure to arsenic contaminated water is an important public health hazard around the world including the united states with millions exposed to drinking water with levels that far exceed world health organisation who guidelines    prenatal arsenic exposure in human populations has been associated with pronounced long term health consequences the evidence comes from studies of    mothers and their children in a province of thailand that experienced heavy arsenic contamination from tin mining similar levels of arsenic are also found in many other regions including the us southwest    leona d samson director of mit s center for environmental health sciences cehs and the american cancer society professor in the departments of biological engineering and biology at mit said we were looking to see whether we could have figured out that these babies were exposed in utero just by using the gene expression screening on the stored blood samples samson says the answer was a resounding yes the gene expression changes the group found in the exposed children are mostly associated with inflammation which can lead to increased cancer risk recognizing the damaging effects of the arsenic exposure the government has provided alternative water sources to the affected villages arsenic contamination of the ron pibul drinking water is roughly the same as that known to be present in many of the western united states suggesting that prenatal arsenic exposure may also be a problem there    it may be a good idea to warn pregnant women of the

       " 'if you like this story feel free to share a mission has begun aboard the turanor planetsolar passionately attempting to be the first to circle the world by waves on a sun powered ship despite being able to travel around the world standing in amazement at the natural beauties that roll beyond waves and shimmer in the sun the planet solar team are confidently carrying an important project with them within this project planetsolar holds two objectives firstly to demonstrate that current and up and coming technologies aimed at improving energy efficiency are reliable and valuable and secondly to advance scientific research in the field of renewable energy their vision is quite an admirable one conserving our planet through the use of promoting solar energy and eco mobility but how did it all start like many inspiring and passionate souls a man named raphael domjan started dreaming and imaging about travelling the world he didn t dream like most do hopping and skipping from plane to plane but wanted to travel using the least amount of energy as possible he wanted to give back to the planet he first visualised achieving his dream with the help of an amphibious microlight during the      s around      domjam s ideas soon began whizzing together as both he and the company horus networks achieved to become the world s first to propose solar powered web hosting and e mails to their clients an idea so unique yet thoroughly intriguing a year after domjam conjured up the idea of achieving the first around the world voyage in a solar boat this idea seemed strange to others at the time as the concept had not taken off or become fashionable in the early      s this meant hard work passion and commitment to develop sponsors and schools to become involved in the project providing a team of motivated enthusiasts who followed his ideas and goals soon started the propelling of his adventure in      all financing for the boat was secured the yacht costing      million in total over     people are currently working for planetsolar to achieve such a stimulating and renewable journey through the oceans the around the globe expedition setting off from monaco the turanor planetsolar will pioneer the use of sustainable energy technology on water this is a rarity to current date nothing has been achieved by motility that works so effectively equipped on board is the very latest cutting edge technology available on the market     solar panels some compact in the extendable wings of the craft sit waiting to absorb the sun s light that can generate up to      kilowatts a perfect demonstration that high performance solar mobility can be achieved built within    months the biggest ever solar boat is striking silent clean and green the four man crew will cross the atlantic ocean panama canal pacific ocean indian finalizing with the suez canal before setting back home by the mediterranean the stopovers along the journey will be organised in large port cities of miami hong kong singapore and cancun for examples so imagine the looks on tourists and natives faces when the large yacht sails up gleaming from the shatters of bounced sun rays hitting the crafts decking during their stops planetsolar will use the platform as promotional spots for renewable energies paying particular attention to solar i must admit a very interesting and excitable way to promote better uses of energy sources but what happens if the sun disappears for a while planetsolar have already got it covered lithium ion batteries in both floats power up the ship during the hours of the night and for up to three sunless days a computer controls the flow of energy to the batteries and motors that rotates the yachts six foot propeller very clever aye and just to be sure planetsolar aim to remain approximately    latitudinal degrees of the equator fully maximising its exposure to the suns glorious rays of power to the craft the extortionate name of the boat turanor was derived from the lord of the rings saga by the famous j r r tolkien and when translated means the power of the sun and victory a very clever and well fitting metaphor to describe such a triumphing educational inspiring eco friendly creation so let s send our wishes to the team abroad the turanor and a huge thank you to the rest of the team behind the face of planetsolar i find nothing more inspirational then wanting to develop break through technology that does not deliver money or a reputation but in fact uses science to achieve and promote sustainability by raising the awareness of the importance of renewable energy whilst demonstrating that economy and ecology can and should work together only gives us readers hope for a cleaner future a huge round of applause

make him play better i guess the superstition worked pretty well as his record was     wins     losses     ties and    shutouts in     nhl regular season games coincidentally another nhl goaltender darren pang also vomited before each game saying that it made him more agile in the net   joe nieuwendyk known as one of the greatest face off men in nhl history joe nieuwendyk also had a couple of superstitions he followed regularly prior to every nhl game he played he would eat exactly two pieces of toast with peanut butter on them even more bizarre he would sprinkle baby powder on the blade of his hockey stick he believed the baby powder had some magical powers that helped him score goals perhaps it worked as nieuwendyk totaled     goals and       points in       nhl regular season games   pelle lindbergh former philadelphia flyers goaltender pelle lindbergh use to wear the same orange t shirt under his equipment during each hockey game the t shirt was never washed and when it would start falling apart he would have it sewn up during intermissions he would drink a swedish beverage called pripps he would only accept the drink if it had two ice cubes was delivered by a certain team trainer and as long as it was in his right hand lindbergh s quirky habits helped him on the ice with a record of    wins    losses and    ties in     nhl regular season games unfortunately lindbergh died as a result of a devastating car crash at just    years of age   brendan shanahan known as a great power forward brendan shanahan had some pretty quirky superstitions during his nhl career he would wear old shoulder pads that dated back to his days in junior hockey he would also listen to madonna on game days obviously the material girl and ancient shoulder pads worked in shanahan s favor as he recorded       points in       nhl regular season games   sidney crosby sidney crosby could very well be the most superstitious player currently in the nhl he will not call his mother on game days as some of his past injuries occurred after he was talking to her if he s travelling with his team on a bus he will lift his feet and touch the glass when they go over railroad tracks if his team is playing on the road he ll only use tape that s provided by the home team for his sticks and when he s done taping his sticks nobody is allowed to touch them or else he ll have to re tape them crosby must be doing something right as he s one of the best hockey players to ever play the game he has won numerous awards including the stanley cup in just his fourth nhl season   patrick roy hall of fame goaltender patrick roy had a long list of superstitions he would never talk to reporters on game days before he played during pre game warm ups he would skate to the blue line stare at his net and picture it shrinking he would also never step on the blue or red lines prior to the games he would lay out his goalie equipment on the locker room floor and dress himself in a certain order then during intermissions he would juggle with a puck and bounce it off the ground and if those weren t bad enough he would quite often talk to his goal posts claiming they are my friends apparently his goal posts were extremely loyal friends as he holds numerous nhl records and won many trophies during his incredible career including four stanley cups   wayne gretzky wayne gretzky is one of the most superstitious players in nhl history he wouldn t get his hair cut while his team was on the road because one time when he did his team suffered a major loss during practice he would start off by shooting a puck to the right of the net he would then drink a diet coke a glass of iced water a gatorade and another diet coke in that exact order as for his uniform he would always put the left side on first and he would always tuck in the right side of his jersey also he would put baby powder on the blade of his hockey stick he most definitely lived up to his nickname the great one as he holds a large amount of nhl records won many trophies and averaged almost two points a game during his illustrious career       points in       games image sources http cache  asset cache net xc        jpg v

       " 'naturalnews the fda has announced that beginning today spinach and lettuce sold across the united states may now be secretly irradiated before it reaches grocery store shelves what s secret about it the fda previously decided that irradiation warning stickers would not be required on any food items because it would be too confusing to consumers the word irradiation apparently has too many letters to be understood to food buyers thus irradiated foods will not be labeled as such and consumers are going to be left in the dark about all this except for those who actually eat the irradiated food in which case they will glow in the dark the fda of course insists that the levels of irradiation used to kill e coli will have no effect whatsoever on the nutritional value of the food this astonishing statement comes from an agency that doesn t believe food has any nutritional value in the first place so lowering the value to zero by destroying all the phytonutrients does not in the opinion of the fda alter its nutritional value at all thus destroying all the anti cancer nutrients in a head of broccoli merely brings that broccoli into compliance as a non functional food according to the fda radiation of course destroys delicate phytochemicals in plants the very phytochemicals protecting consumers against cancer heart disease high cholesterol inflammation and other diseases microwaving broccoli for example destroys up to    of its anti cancer nutrients the fda has not yet acknowledged this scientific fact either in a similar way irradiating food destroys much of its nutritional content including vitamins carotenoids anthocyanins and other delicate protective nutrients that are right now providing the last desperate nutritional defense against the american diet of meat milk fried foods and processed junk irradiating fresh produce will leave the u s population is a state of extreme deficiency in protective plant based nutrients many people suspect that s what the fda really wants a nutritionally deficient disease ridden population would mean a windfall of profits for the fda s buddies in big pharma the folks who sell patented medications at monopoly prices with the food supply destroyed by radiation ordinary people would have virtually no remaining sources of protective phytonutrients in promoting this food radiation policy the fda has accomplished what all the terrorists in the world could not the mass irradiation of the u s food supply much like setting off a dirty bomb over the nation s farms but with less radiation this destruction of the nutritional value of the food supply is a far greater threat to the health of the u s population than any terrorist event including      and yet it is being done by our own people to our own people by a lawless agency that answers to no one fda officials are not voted into office by the people they are appointed by politicians they answer to no one they refuse to follow federal law and they operate as tyrants over a quarter of the u s economy and now they have taken it upon themselves to destroy the national food supply we should be more than just alarmed we should be outraged the fda has committed an act of war against the people with this decision the fda has firmly positioned itself as an enemy of the people and a bringer of death and disease to the nation why are our elected representatives in washington allowing this madness think about this if the fda has its way all your food will be irradiated pasteurized or killed all your children will be vaccinated all your medicine will be based on pharmaceuticals all your free speech about health will be suppressed all informative labeling on food and supplements will be outlawed growing and selling non irradiated garden vegetables will become a crime don t think the fda will stop with spinach and lettuce either they re already talking about irradiating tomatoes peppers and onions before long radiation could become mandatory for all fresh produce and all the fresh fruits and vegetables that are supposed to contain health protecting nutrients will be transformed into sterile inert plant mass with no health benefits at all brilliant scam huh this is by design i believe the fda wants the american public to be sickened and diseased why else would they ban free speech about healing foods like cherries broccoli and garlic why would they outlaw the selling of herbs and nutritional supplements that claim to treat and prevent disease the fda wants you to be sick enslaved and medicated and irradiating the food supply is the quickest way to accomplish that he who controls the food controls the people he who destroys the food can profit from the people s sickness in pushing this radiation agenda the fda is committing a crime against humanity a nutritional atrocity that violates fundamental human rights and yet the fda s top decision makers continue to operate with zero oversight and zero accountability they make decisions in a corporate sponsored vacuum absent any input from reasonable health conscious consumers or scientists and because they have been granted tyrannical powers by congress the fda operates above the law it is not subject to any laws whatsoever not even the u s constitution which is supposed to protect the people s right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as stated in the declaration of independence the mass irradiation of the food supply is a violation of the life part of that phrase wouldn t you agree if we can no longer buy nourishing foods with their nutrients intact then we are all doomed to degenerative disease and death but not before paying out our life savings to doctors drug companies and hospitals that s the evil genius of the food irradiation plot it kills you slowly at just the right pace to drain your bank account before you expire from malnutrition i truly believe this irradiation of the food supply is the beginning of the end of america no nation can survive the destruction of its food supply the fda is dooming america to a slow painful medicated death in a generation this nation will be lost destroyed from within by short sighted tyrants who violated nature and left the people to rot for starters you can   grow your own food a little gardening is good grow whatever you can even if it s just a few kitchen herbs   buy your food at farmer s markets coops and csas see http www localharvest org csa  ask your grocery store if they are buying irradiated spinach if they don t know demand they find out   raise hell with your senators and congresspeople demanding they pass new laws protecting consumers from the fda and its plot to destroy the nutritional value of the food supply also listen to two podcasts i ve posted on this topic the first was recorded several months ago where i publicly predicted the fda would do exactly what we re seeing right now listen to that podcast here http www naturalnews com index po the second podcast was just posted today i recorded it right before writing this article it goes into much greater detail about the fda s plot to destroy the health of the u s population you can listen to that here http www naturalnews com index po finally don t stand for this food supply madness raise your voice write your local paper call your representatives in washington and tell them you strongly oppose the irradiation of the food supply teach people about phytonutrients and stay tuned to naturalnews as we continue to cover this important story the fda has gone mad criminally mad it is an agency that will literally kill you if given the chance and it is up to all of us to stop this madness before we lose our health our children and our very nation about

       " 'nine stars our highest ranking right out of the box there seemed to be something a bit different about our new apollo extreme starter kit the components appeared to be a little larger than what we had been used to seeing measuring one of the two lithium ion cigarette style batteries confirmed our first impression at    inches in length the apollo extreme is about a half inch longer than most electronic cigarette batteries double end capped and plugged to maintain freshness the cartridge atomizers are longer as well measuring    inches as opposed to the standard    inches in addition to the two batteries and five cartridge atomizers the apollo extreme starter kit includes the user manual a usb charger an ac wall adaptor and a car charger adaptor an accessory that is not often included in starter kits currently priced at five for       apollo extreme cartridge atomizers are available in tobacco menthol vanilla coffee and cherry flavors in your choice of high medium low and zero nicotine levels order    or more packs for bulk pricing of   cartridge atomizers for       we next screwed a tobacco high cartridge atomizer onto the battery and took a good drag we were rewarded with satisfying tobacco flavor and exhaled an expansive plume of beautiful white vapor so far so good a second drag produced the same result a rich tobacco flavor and an impressive white vapor cloud drawing on the apollo was quiet and easy there were no crackling or popping sounds an unfortunate quality we have come to associate with lesser e cigarette brands pleased with our first apollo electronic cigarette experience we set one of the batteries to charge and decided to resume our testing the next day the following day we unplugged our now fully charged battery and screwed it onto another tobacco high cartridge atomizer we took our first drag and were once again well pleased with the resulting flavor and vapor apollo extreme was proving to be a new smoking pleasure while the apollo extreme excels in many ways perhaps the most remarkable thing about it is the price editor top   electronic cigarettes handling the apollo extreme one cannot help but notice that the slightly larger and heavier components are well designed and crafted the excellent fit and finish are complimented by long lasting cartridge atomizers equal to about a pack and a half of cigarettes and superior battery life the more we smoked our apollo e cigarette the better we liked it while the apollo extreme excels in many ways perhaps the most remarkable thing about it is the price at       it is priced substantially lower than comparably equipped starter kits of lesser quality and provides a superior value that is difficult to beat additionally and unlike most electronic cigarette retailers apollo owns its own factories and labs investment in the research and development of e cigarette technology is yet another reason to believe that one you are buying from apollo you are purchasing a state of the art product from a company that stands behind its products if you are a one pack a day or more smoker interested in making the switch to electric we could hardly think of a better choice than apollo extreme it gets the job done beautifully it s a joy to smoke and it s inexpensive editor top   electronic cigarettes we tried to think of downsides to the apollo extreme and came up with only one possibility it is slightly larger than the average electronic cigarette about   measuring    fully assembled it is similar in size and weight to green smoke when using the longer of the two supplied batteries and the new flavormax cartridge atomizers the positives associated with the larger size are however substantial the       mah battery will last longer than a standard cigarette style battery and the larger cartridge atomizer provides about a pack and a half worth of smoking with superior vapor volume if you are a social smoker making the switch to e cigarettes the apollo extreme may not be the right choice for you but if you are a one pack a day or more smoker interested in making the switch to electric we could hardly think of a better choice than apollo extreme it gets the job done beautifully it s a joy to smoke and it s inexpensive we estimated that including the starter kit purchase the cost to maintain a one pack per day cigarette habit using apollo extreme was only        annually or       per month or       per week or only      per day we found apollo extreme to be a superior value when compared to the cost of traditional cigarettes and the same one pack per day habit at      per pack or         per year or        per month or       per week or      per day the annual savings for an apollo extreme smoker is         in summary we found apollo extreme starter kit at       to be a superior value shipping is free and in addition to the one year limited warranty it includes a    day money back guarantee big pluses in our book

ablaze smashing windows showering giant tv screens with beer bottles and dancing atop overturned vehicles later looters smashed windows and ran inside department stores we have a small number of hooligans on the streets of vancouver causing problems vancouver mayor gregor robertson said it s absolutely disgraceful and shameful and by no means represents the city of vancouver we have had an extraordinary run in the playoff great celebration what s happened tonight is despicable police said they had reports of four stabbings though spokeswoman const jana mcguinness said she couldn t confirm them officers from around the region flooded into downtown and robertson said things were getting under control but the images and atmosphere that persisted late into the night suggested otherwise it took about four hours before downtown quieted again while robertson said there had been no fatalities ambulances appeared to be having trouble getting inside the zone to help the injured tv images showed at least one woman mopping blood from her forehead you don t ever hope for a situation like this mcguinness said you celebrate the good times and you prepare for the bad times and that s exactly what we ve done unfortunately the tables have turned tonight we will have to sit down and evaluate exactly what happened here it s going to be a black mark for a very very long time at a bay store looters were seen grabbing t shirts and anything else they could get their hands on young women were seen escaping with mac cosmetics with one carrying out part of a mannequin the landmark building was filling with smoke as people their faces covered in bandannas continued the violence the bay became a target with windows smashed to allow looters to get to the expensive coach and burberry purses merchandise went flying into the street women rampaged through the main floor makeup department tossing each other products and squealing in delight another fire erupted nearby in an area littered with abandoned canucks memorabilia and hand lettered signs expressing support for the team the violence appeared to start when fans set fire to a stuffed bear decorated to symbolize the bruins others sang a drunken tune as they danced on an overturned vehicle it s terrible canucks captain henrik sedin said shaking his head this city and province has a lot to be proud of the team we have and the guys we have in here it s too bad the looters turned their attention next on a future shop store a few blocks away smashing windows and flooding up the stairs to the second floor store only to turn around quickly one witness said police were at the top of the stairs sears and chapters stores were also looted their glass fronts smashed for many the ugly chaos made the cup loss an afterthought what i ve seen is a complete disgrace said beth hope    who is originally from england but has lived in vancouver for two years i m a canucks fan but my jersey s in my bag i m ashamed to be a fan right now hope said she saw a parkade on fire and cars ablaze it s insane it s absolutely insane she said what s the point our team lost why destroy your own city i m afraid nba star steve nash from nearby victoria and the brother in law of canucks forward manny malhotra sent a twitter message imploring the fans to stop the violence we re a great city and have a lot of class our team is great and our championship will come soon nash wrote robertson praised the police and firefighters and asked people to stay away from the central downtown area it is extremely disappointing to see the situation in downtown vancouver turn violent after tonight s stanley cup game robertson said vancouver is a world class city and it is embarrassing and shameful to see the type of violence and disorder we ve seen tonight the vast majority of people who were in the downtown tonight were there to enjoy the game in a peaceful and respectful manner it is unfortunate that a small number of people intent on criminal activity have turned pockets of the downtown into areas involving destruction of property and confrontations with police tear gas mingled with the stench of acrid smoke and stale beer as riot police truncheons drawn moved in to quell the violence pushing crowds away from the burning cars later police cars also were set on fire at one point police were using flash bangs grenades that are designed to distract and disorient rather than injure to try to break up the mob this isn t what the canucks are about said chad mcmillan    a vancouver resident and canucks fan this isn t what their fans are about this isn t what this city is about flames leaped from at least two flipped vehicles in the middle of trash strewn streets filling the downtown core with heavy black smoke in the moments immediately following the game i heard a loud noise and turned and there was a car being stomped on by a bunch of guys    year old witness brandon sinclair said about the first few moments of violence a bunch of guys started rocking it then they flipped it over and five minutes later it was on fire and then they flipped another one it was just out of control bright orange flames were seen shooting nearly    yards into the air as bystanders tossed firecrackers television images showed a large fire burning inside a parking garage but it wasn t clear what was ablaze a small group of rioters appeared to be at the heart of the action reminiscent of a similar scene that erupted in the city in      following the canucks game   loss to the new york rangers mcguinness said those responsible for this latest damage had an average age of    or    and were downtown specifically to wreak mayhem not to watch hockey they ve embarrassed our city and taken away that pride that we had she said for two weeks the city hosted thousands of fans in areas set aside with gigantic screens for watching the games as the canucks progressed through the playoffs police officers high fived passers by and spectators were well behaved win or lose game   was different mcguinness said police aren t blaming alcohol consumption there was more during game   on friday night but she also bristled at the notion that the force s so called meet and greet strategy was misguided i would completely disagree that there is complacency she said we are very aware in a crowd situation that things can change we watch for those flashpoints in a crowd when flames erupted from an exploding car bystanders ducked out of fear fans who were trying simply to get out of the danger zone found their visibility reduced by the thick black smoke about an hour after the game some bold troublemakers started hurling garbage and bottles at police officers who deflected the debris with riot shields protesters who rushed the police line were quickly subdued with blows from a truncheon some protesters held what looked like pipes or hockey sticks over their heads as they jeered at officers newspaper boxes were wrenched off the sidewalk and hurled through store windows portable toilets were tipped as the stifling black smoke spread through the city s core while some members of the crowd expressed dismay that the police didn t take a more aggressive approach to the early vandalism others said officers were heavy handed there s people who ve been coming through the crowds suffering from tear gas said    year old amy zevick i m seriously disappointed in the city of vancouver and the country of canada because it makes me feel the insecurity i read about in other parts of the world i don t think it s ok to loot but i also don t think it s ok to over police and assume that every person is guilty some seemed to revel in the rampage recording the vandalism on cell phones and video cameras a few congratulated those who tried to attack police and others erupted with cheers every time something was damaged at least two young men covered in soot reported being roughed up by the police but they weren t arrested rivers of poured out alcohol broken glass and trash made navigating the streets treacherous fans wandered amid the chaos some with bandanas or t shirts pulled over their faces either to hide their faces from police and tv cameras or to guard against the smoke or both what is most disappointing and disturbing is that we have spectators who will not go home b c solicitor general shirley bond said we need everyone to pay attention we need them to leave the downtown and they need to stop treating this as a spectator sport this is a dangerous situation where

       " 'researchers from emory university school of medicine university of colorado at boulder and johns hopkins university school of medicine decided to try to figure out exactly how exercise benefits the heart and why humans who exercise and have a heart attack have improved survival compared to non exercisers they found that a four week voluntary exercise program  in mice protected them from experimental induced heart injury a benefit that was sustained for a full week following the last session of exercise it is well known that aerobic exercise activates the production of friendly nitric oxide enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide by activating the enzyme that helps make enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide endothelial nitric oxide synthase in turn the extra enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide helps the heart and circulation relax and blood to flow easier interestingly the researchers found that enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide was converted by the heart and in circulation and stored as an enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide savings account enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide was attached to a protein via sulfur taking the form of nitrite and nitrosothiols this stored enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide could then be released out of the savings account as needed to help the heart or circulation function better even under stress also of interest is that aerobic exercise activates fat burning almost immediately this study found that the activation of adrenalin receptors within white adipose tissue    adrenergic receptors was essential for optimal enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide production and storage linking the health of white adipose tissue to the cardiovascular protective response of exercise our study provides new evidence that nitric oxide generated during physical exercise is stored in the bloodstream and heart in the form of nitrite and nitrosothiols these more stable nitric oxide intermediates appear to be critical for the cardioprotection against a subsequent heart attack said senior author david lefer phd professor of surgery at emory university school of medicine there are several points to understand the endorphin anti inflammatory benefit from aerobic exercise tends to last about    hours assuming you are getting a good response to exercise this enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response is synergistic and different once conditioned by regular aerobic exercise then a savings account of protective enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide builds up that appears to last for approximately   week if exercise is stopped both anti inflammatory mechanisms are very important to your health this animal research showed that    adrenergic receptors were essential for this enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response this study was not done using fat mice in overweight humans there is adrenalin resistance in white adipose tissue which is likely to blunt this healthy enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response in overweight people on the other hand as a person loses weight while exercising aerobically then the adrenaline resistance will go away and the cardioprotective enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide will be boosted this is yet another good reason to get in a weight loss mode if you are overweight it also means that if you are really out of shape you should begin your fitness gradually as the inability to activate these    adrenergic receptors in white adipose tissue actually causes increased cardio stress from exercise you can use nutrition to help improve this scenario this can be done by anyone who wants to enhance the enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response and would be especially important in someone trying to get themselves onto a good exercise program and build up a better state of fitness nutrients such as grape seed extract and resveratrol natural phenol or type of antioxidant found in red grapes red wine research has shown beneficial effects as anti cancer and anti inflammatory agents along with supporting healthy blood sugar and cardiovasculature function   are known to boost the activity of friendly enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase nutrients such as n acetyl cysteine whey protein msm sulfur and r alpha lipoic acid would all provide thiol related raw materials to help make the storage compounds for enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide unfriendly and inflammatory nitric oxide inos inducible nitric oxide synthase this enzyme influences genes located in the neuro immune and cardiovascular system and provides immune defense against pathogens and contributes to disease progression including neurogenic inflammation inos  wreaks havoc in your body brain and cardiovascular system in order to be healthy you need to have more enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide than inos inducible nitric oxide synthase this enzyme influences genes located in the neuro immune and cardiovascular system and provides immune defense against pathogens and contributes to disease progression including neurogenic inflammation inos  a great way to boost up your enos endothelial nitric oxide synthase type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide supply is to exercise assuming you get a good response to that exercise various nutrients can enhance your exercise response and may be very important especially for unfit people who are trying to get on a healthy path to recovering their fitness exercise  enos  inos

       " 'while the queen of hearts should be leading her kingdom she s instead baking this who could blame her the queen of hearts certainly gets a lot of attention songs nursery rhymes and disney villains are centered on her royal presence it might be because she s the monarch of the most tender of suits it might be her circus freak appearance what with her lower torso being a twin who was only half absorbed in the womb and both wearing matching robes and wimples maybe her green thumb and affinity for tiny flowers but personally i think it s because we adore her fondness of tarts i submit the following evidence the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer s day the knave of hearts he stole the tarts and took them clean away the king of hearts called for the tarts and beat the knave full sorethe knave of hearts brought back the tarts andvowed he d steal no more to have your hubby kick the heck out of a guy like he s an old soup can because he stole a tart i dare you to find a greater example of someone s love for good food now obviously the queen was being selfish royalty or not she should share her tarts that s why the knave stole them he was hungry and wanted a taste and really can you blame him i mean look at this tart chocolate caramel more chocolate and salt what s not to love who wouldn t steal a piece i would totally snag a slice of tart if it were just lying around but i d be smart to pack a tazer to take down kingy and if he wasn t around and i had to deal with the queen proper well i doubt something like      volts will take her down

will be here sooner then you think ugh let s not even discuss it it brings on a mixed mess of excitement and anxiety also i have decided to get into this crazy blog competition which i hope i will get to continue till the end by the way today is the last day to vote for round   so click on my face right over there on the right and vote i got an interesting dish planned for round   in the mean time i have cooked this beauty up to hold you over i had a bag of tortellini sitting in the freezer or awhile now and i had a feeling that it was time to bust it out and put it to good use the thing was i wasn t really in the mood for a red sauce i was feeling a white sauce would be better i knew i also wanted oozy gooey cheesy goodness i thought about it all morning i walked around the house while i cleaned thumping my head with my pointer finger saying think think think it was a little reminiscent of winne the pooh which i am not sure is good or bad at the age of    i started to think about how much i love the fall and i would love to had a little fall twist to the dish immediately i thought of sage and mushrooms and that is when it hit me mascarpone mozzarella sage and mushrooms i don t know why but i was so excited i grabbed my keys and purse and ran out to the grocery store looking like a hot mess mind you i was in the middle of sweeping and mopping the floor after all i am almost sure i had some hair standing straight up since i hadn t put a brush in it yet however this moment wasn t about fashion that was the last thing on my mind obviously since i was wearing paint splotched shorts out in public in fact if i had gone to wal mart i am sure that i would have ended up on people of wal mart luckily enough target was closer i wore my biggest shades and a baseball cap and prayed no one would recognize me in my hot mess condition i quickly gathered all of my ingredients and headed back home pre heat oven to     degrees heat a skillet over medium high heat with   tbs of olive oil add sliced sausage to the pan and cook until evenly browned using a slotted spoon transfer the sausage to a plate and set aside in the same pan saute garlic and onions add mushrooms and saute at a medium heat until browned about    minutes you don t want to over cook the mushrooms because they are going to bake in the oven for an additional    minutes they should be brown but still firm prepare tortellini according to package instructions drain drizzle with olive oil cover with a kitchen towel and set aside until ready to use in a food processor combine mascarpone cheese and sage leaves process until smooth add mascarpone cheese mixture and sausage to the mushrooms stir until smooth and creamy if using cream cheese it may be too thick add a little bit of chicken broth to thin the sauce to a desired consistency season with salt and pepper to taste don t be shy if you are afraid of over salting i recommend you get some kosher salt it is hard to over salt when you use kosher salt add mushroom cream sauce to prepared tortellini and toss spray an   x   baking dish with non stick spray pour tortellini into baking dish top with torn fresh mozzarella if you can get your hands on a fresh mozzarella i highly recommend it it melts so much better and smoother then packaged shredded or block mozzarella the streachy ooey gooeyness cannot be beat place in the oven and bake for    minutes or until cheese is brown and bubbly remove from oven and serve garnish with minced sage check it out mushrooms cream sausage and cheese cheese people i love cheese your family is going to rain hugs and kisses on you i promise i can t tell a lie when i took my first bite i was immediately beaming with pride this stuff was good and for just a moment i was over come with a delirious case of i think i am all that insert snapping fingers heat shake and stood proud on top of my royal blue counter top arm raised and wooden spoon in hand declaring myself the queen of creamy mushroom baked tortellini awesomeness yeah i smacked my head on the drop ceiling but what did i care i was queen of creamy mushroom baked tortellini awesomeness ok i didn t do that but i thought about it we all have our moments of grandiose illusions if i had had room i would have gone back for seconds and thirds but this is pretty filling the tortellini was perfectly cooked the mushrooms made it earthy and the sage gave me my first taste of fall the great thing is that this is easy to change up if you don t like sage use basil if you don t like mushrooms caramelize some cubed butternut squash in a pan with butter and if you want to get really creative i bet some chopped pecan and dry cranberries would be great in this mmmmmm i think i see another variation in the future print recipe creamy
